        "{@--1@} <ab>N.</ab> of a sage, regarded as\nthe ancestor of the family of the\nBhṛgus, and described in <ls>Ms. 1. 35</ls>\nas one of the ten patriarchs created\nby the first Manu; (said to be so\ncalled because he was produced along\nwith flames; {#saha jvAlABirutpanno#} \n{#BfgustasmAdBfguH smftaH#}). [On one occasion when the\nsages could not agree as to which of the\nthree gods, Brahman, Viṣṇu and Śiva,\nwas best entitled to the worship of \nBrāhmaṇas, the sage Bhṛgu was sent to test\nthe character of the three gods. He\nfirst went to the abode of Brahman, and,\non approaching him, purposely omitted\nan obeisance. Upon this the god \nreprehended him severely, but was \npacified by apologies. Next he entered the\nabode of Śiva in Kailāsa, and omitted,\nas before, all tokens of adoration. The\nvindictive deity was enraged and would\nhave destroyed him, had he not \n\nconciliated him by mild words. (According to \nanother account, Bhṛgu was coldly \nreceived by Brahman, and he, therefore, \ncursed him that he would receive no worship\nor adoration; and condemned Śiva to\ntake the form of a {%Liṅga%}, as he got no\naccess to the deity who was engaged in\nprivate with his wife). Lastly he went\nto Viṣṇu, and finding him asleep, he\nboldly gave the god a kick on his breast\nwhich at once awoke him. Instead of\nshowing anger, however, the God arose,\nand on seeing Bhṛgu, inquired tenderly\nwhether his foot was hurt, and then \nbegan to rub it gently. ‘This’, said \nBhṛgu, ‘is the mightiest god. He overtops\nall by the most potent of all \nweaponskindness and generosity’. Viṣṇu was\ntherefore, declared to be the god who\nwas best entitled to the worship of all].\n",
