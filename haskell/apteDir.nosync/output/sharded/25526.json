        "<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated sage,\nand author of the Rāmāyaṇa.\n[He was a Brāhmaṇa by birth, but\nbeing abandoned by his parents in his\nchildhood, he was found by some wild\nmountaineers who taught him the art\nof thieving. He soon became an adept\nin the art, and pursued his business\nof plundering and killing (where \nnecessary) travellers for several years. One\nday he saw a great sage whom he asked\non pain of death to deliver up his \npossessions. But the sage told him to go\nhome and ask his wife and children\nif they were ready to become his \n\npartners in the innumerable iniquities that\nhe had committed. He accordingly\nwent home, but returned dismayed at\ntheir unwillingness. The sage then\ntold him to repeat the word {%marā%}\n(which is {%Rāma%} inverted) and \ndisappeared. The robber continued to\nrepeat it for years together without\nmoving from the place, so that his body\nwas covered up with ant-hills. But\nthe same sage reappeared and got him\nout, and as he issued from the  \n‘{%valmīka%}’ he was called {%Vālmīki%}, and \nbecame afterwards an eminent sage. One\nday while he was performing his \nablutions, he saw one of a pair of {%Krauncha%}\nbirds being killed by a fowler, at\nwhich he cursed the wretch in words\nwhich unconsciously took the form of\na verse in the Anuṣṭubh metre. This\nwas a new mode of composition, and\nat the command of the god Brahman\nhe composed the first poem the \nRāmāyaṇa. When Sītā was abandoned by\nRāma, he gave her shelter under his\nroof, and brought up her two sons.\nHe afterwards restored them all to\nRāma]."
