        "<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated \nmonkeychief, who was slain by Rāma at the\ndesire of Sugrīva, his younger\nbrother. [He is represented as a very\npowerful monkey, and is said to have\nplaced under his arm-pit even Rāvaṇa\nwhen he went to fight with him. \nDuring his absence from Kiṣkindhā to slay\nthe brother of Dundubhi, Sugrīva \nusurped the throne considering him to be\ndead, but when Vāli returned, he had to\nrun away to Ṛṣyamūka. Tārā, wife\nof Sugrīva, was seized by Vāli, but she\nwas restored to her husband when Rāma\nslew him.]"
