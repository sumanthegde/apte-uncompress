[She was very pious and given\nto austere devotion by virtue of which she\nhad obtained miraculous powers. Several\nstories are told to illustrate them. When\nthe earth was devastated by a terrible\ndrought which lasted for 10 years, \nAnasūya created water, fruits, roots &c. by\nmeans of her ascetic powers and saved\nmany lives. On one occasion when\nthe sage Māṇḍavya was about to be\nimpaled, the wife of a sage happened to\ntouch the stake as she passed by, where\nupon Māṇḍavya cursed her that she\nwould become a widow at sunrise. She,\nhowever, prevented the sun from rising,\nand all actions of men being \n\nconsequently stopped, the gods, sages &c.\nwent to Anasūyā, her friend, who, by\nthe force of her penance, made the sun\nrise without, at the same time, bringing\nwidowhood on her friend. Another\nlegend is also told in which Anasūyā\nchanged Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśa\ninto infants, when, at the instigation of\ntheir wives, they attempted to test her\nchastity, but restored them to their \nformer shapes at the importunities of their\nhumbled consorts. She is also said to\nhave caused the three-streamed Ganges\nto flow down on the earth near the\nhermitage of her husband for the \nablutions of sages; see <ls>R. 13. 51.</ls> In the\nRāmāyaṇa she is represented as having\nbeen very kind and attentive to Sītā\nwhom she favoured with sound \nmotherly advice on the virtues of chastity, and\nat the time of her departure gave her\nan unguent (See <ls>R. 12. 27</ls>, <ls n=\"R.\">14. 14</ls>)\nwhich was to keep her beautiful for ever\nand to guard her person from the \nattempts of rapacious beasts, demons &c.\nShe was the mother of the irascible\nsage Durvāsas]."
