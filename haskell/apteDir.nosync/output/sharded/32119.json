        "<ab>N.</ab> of a country situated, according to the\nRāmāyaṇa, along the banks of the Sarayū (or\nGogrā). It was divided into ‘Uttara-Kośala’\nand ‘Dakshiṇa Kośala.’ The former is also called\n‘Ganda’, and it must have therefore signified the\ncountry north of Ayodhyā comprising Gaṇḍa\nand Baraitch. Aja, Daśaratha &c. are said to have\nruled over this province. At the time of Rāma's\ndeath his two sons Kuśa and Lava reigned \nrespectively at Kuśāvatī in southern Kośala in the \ndefiles of the Vindhyas, and at Śrāvastī in northern\nKośala."
