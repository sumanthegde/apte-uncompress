Though thus\nconvinced of her chastity, he had \nafterwards to abandon her, when far \nadvanced in pregnancy, because the people\ncontinued to suspect her fidelity. She,\nhowever, found a protector, in the sage\nVālmīki, at whose hermitage she was\ndelivered of Kuśa and Lava, and who\nbrought them up. She was ultimately\nrestored to Rāma by the sage.].\n",
