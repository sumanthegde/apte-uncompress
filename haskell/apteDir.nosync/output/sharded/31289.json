        "<ab>N.</ab> of a king of the solar\ndynasty. [He was the son of \nTriśanku and was famous for his\nliberality, probity, and unflinching \nadherence to truth. On one occasion\nhis family-priest Vasiṣṭha \ncommended his qualities in the presence of\nViśvāmitra, who refused to believe them.\nA quarrel thereupon ensued, and it\nwas at last decided that Viśvāmitra\nshould himself test the king. The\nsage accordingly subjected him to the\nmost crucial test with a view to see\nif he could not be but once made to\nswerve from his plighted word. The\nking, however, stood the test with\nexemplary courage, adhering to his\nword though he had to forego the\nkingdom, to sell off his wife and\nson, and at last, even his own self to\na low-caste man, and-as the last\ntest, as it were, of his truthfulness\nand courage-to be even ready to\nput his own wife to death as a\nwitch! Viśvāmitra there-upon \nacknowledged himself vanquished, and\nthe worthy king was elevated along\nwith his subjects to heaven]."
