        "<ab>N.</ab> of a Vedic\nsage, son of Ajīgarta. [In the \nAitareya Brāhmaṇa it is related that king\nHariścandra, being childless, made a\nvow that on obtaining a son he would\nsacrifice him to the god Varuṇa. A son\nwas born who was named Rohita, but\nthe king put off the fulfilment of the\nvow under various pretexts. At last \nRohita purchased for one hundred cows\nŚunaḥśepha, the middle son of \nAjīgarta, as a substitute for himself to be\noffered to Varuṇa. But the boy \npraised Viṣṇu, Indra, and other deities, and\nescaped death. He was then adopted\nby Viśvāmitra in his own family and\ncalled by the name Devarāta]."
