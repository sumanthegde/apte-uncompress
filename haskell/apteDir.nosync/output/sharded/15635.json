        "<ab>N.</ab> of the daughter of\nŚukra, preceptor of the {%Asuras%}.\n[She fell in love with Kaca, her\nfather's pupil, but he rejected her\nadvances. On this she cursed the\nyouth, who in return cursed her that\nshe should become the wife of a\nKṣatriya; (see {#kaca#}). Once upon a\ntime Devayānī and her companion\nŚarmiṣṭhā--the daughter of \nVṛshaparvan, the king of the Daityas,\nwent to bathe keeping their clothes\non the shore. But the god Wind \nchanged their clothes, and when they were\ndressed they began to quarrel about the\nchange until Śarmiṣṭhā so far lost\nher temper that she slapped \nDevayānī's face, and threw her into a well.\nThere she remained until she was seen\nand rescued by Yayāti, who, with the\nconsent of her father, married her, and\nŚarmiṣṭhā became her servant as a\nrecompense for her insulting conduct\ntowards her. Devayānī lived happily\nwith Yayāti for some years and bore\nhim two sons, Yadu and Turvasu.\nSubsequently her husband became \nenamoured of Śarmiṣṭhā, and Devayānī,\nfeeling herself aggrieved, abruptly left\nher husband and went home to her\nfather, who at her request condemned\nYayāti with the infirmity of old age;\nsee Yayāti also]."
