Rāma \nkilled them all with perfect ease, and \nreceived from the sage several miraculous\nmissiles as a reward. He then \naccompanied Viśvāmitra to the capital of \nJanaka where he married Sītā having \nperformed the wonderful feat of bending\nŚiva's bow, and then returned to \nAyodhyā. Daśaratha, seeing that Rāma was\ngrowing fitter and fitter to rule the \nkingdom, resolved to install him as \nheir-apparent. But, on the eve of the day of\ncoronation, his favourite wife Kaikeyī,\nat the instigation of her wicked nurse\nMantharā, asked him to fulfil the two\nboons he had formerly promised to her,\nby one of which she demanded the\nexile of Rāma for fourteen years and\nby the other the installation of her own\nson Bharata as Yuvarāja. The king\nwas terribly shocked, and tried his best\nto dissuade her from her wicked \ndemands, but was at last obliged to yield.\nThe dutiful son immediately prepared\nto go into exile accompanied by his\nbeautiful young wife Sītā and his \ndevoted brother Lakṣmaṇa. The period\nof his exile was eventful, and the two\nbrothers killed several powerful demons\nand at last roused the jealousy of \nRāvaṇa himself. The wicked demon \nresolved to try Rāma by carrying off his \n\nbeauteous wife for whom he had \nconceived an ardent passion, and \naccomplished his purpose being assisted by \nMārīcha. After several fruitless inquiries\nas to her whereabouts, Hanumat \nascertained that she was in Laṅkā and \npersuaded Rāma to invade the island and\nkill the ravisher. The monkeys built\na bridge across the ocean over which\nRāma with his numerous troops passed,\nconquered Laṅkā, and killed Rāvaṇa\nalong with his whole host of demons.\nRāma, attended by his wife and friends\nin battle, triumphantly returned to \nAyodhyā where he was crowned king by\nVasiṣṭha. He reigned long and \nrighteously and was succeeded by his son \nKuśa. Rāma is said to be the seventh \nincarnation of Viṣṇu; <ab>cf.</ab> Jayadeva:  \n--{#vitarasi dikzu raRe dikpatikamanIyaM#} \n{#daSamuKamOlibaliM ramaRIyaM . keSava DftaraGupatirUpa#} \n{#jaya jagadISa hare#} <ls>Gīt. 1</ls> ].
