                "<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated sage\nand author of many Vedic hymns.\n[He appears in the Vedas in hymns\naddressed to Agni, Indra, the Aśvins\nand the Viśvedevas. In the \nSvāyambhuva Manvantara he appears as one\nof the ten Prajāpatis or mind-born sons\nof Brahmā, being born from his eye.\nThese sons having died by the curse of\nŚiva, Brahmā performed a sacrifice, at\nthe beginning of the present Vaivasvata\nManvantara, and Atri was born from\nthe flames of Agni. Anasūyā was his\nwife in both lives. In the first she bore\nhim three sons, Datta, Durvāsas and\nSoma; in the second she had two \nadditional children, a son by name \nAryaman and a daughter called Amalā. In\nthe Rāmāyaṇa an account is given of\nthe visit paid by Rāma and Sītā to Atri\nand Anasūyā in their hermitage, when\nthey both received them most kindly;\nSee Anasūyā. As a Ṛṣi or sage he is one\nof the seven sages who were all sons of\nBrahmā, and represents in Astronomy\none of the stars of the Great Bear \nsituated in the north. He is also the author\nof a code of laws known as {#atrismfti#} or\n{#atrisaMhitA#}. In the Purāṇas he is said to\nhave produced the moon from his eye,\nwhile he was practising austere penance,\nthe moon being in consequence called\n{#atrija, --jAta, --dfgja, atrinetraprasUta, --°praBava#},\n{#°Bava#} &c.; <ab>cf.</ab> also {#aTa nayanasamutTaM#} \n{#jyotiratreriva dyOH#} <ls>R. 2. 75</ls> and {#atreriveMduH#}  \n<ls>V. 5. 21.</ls>] --(<ab>pl.</ab>) descendants of Atri."
