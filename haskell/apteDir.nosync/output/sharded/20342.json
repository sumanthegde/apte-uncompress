        "An epithet of Cupid, the\ngod of love. [He was a son of Kṛṣṇa\nand Rukmiṇī. When only six years\nold, he was stolen away by the demon\nŚambara, for he was foretold that \nPradyumna would be his destroyer. \nŚambara cast the child into the roaring sea,\nand a large fish swallowed it. This\nfish was caught by a fisherman and\ntaken to the demon; and when it was\ncut up, a beautiful child came out from \n\nthe belly, and Māyāvatī, the \nmistress of Śambara's household, at the\ndesire of Nārada, carefully reared him\nfrom childhood. As he grew up, she\nwas fascinated by the beauty of his \nperson, but Pradyumna reproved her for\nentertaining towards himself feelings so\nunbecoming a mother as he considered\nher. But when he was told that he was\nnot her son, but of Viṣṇu and was cast\ninto the sea by Śambara, he became\nenraged, and challenging him to fight,\nsucceeded in killing him by the force of\nillusions. He and Māyāvatī afterwards\nrepaired to the house of Kṛṣṇa, where\nNārada told him and Rukmi{%ni%} that the\nboy was their own and that Māyāvatī\nwas his wife]."
