        "A king of the Sindhu\ndistrict and brother-in-law of \n\nDuryodhana, having married Duḥśalā,\ndaughter of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. [Once\nwhile out on hunting, he chanced to see\nDraupadī in the forest, and asked of her\nfood for himself and his retinue. \nDraupadī, by virtue of her magical {%sthāli%},\nwas able to supply him with materials\nsufficient for their break-fast. \nJayadratha was so much struck with this\nact, as well as her personal charms, that\nhe asked her to elope with him. She,\nof course, indignantly refused, but he\nsucceeded in carrying her off, as her\nhusbands were out on hunting. When\nthey returned they pursued and captured\nthe ravisher and released Draupadī; and\nhe himself was allowed to go after \nhaving been subjected to many humiliations.\nHe took a leading part in compassing\nthe death of Abhimanyu, and met his\ndoom at the hands of Arjuna in the\ngreat war.]."
