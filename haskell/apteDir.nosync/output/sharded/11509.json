                "A\ndaughter of the prince of the \nKekayas and one (the youngest) of the\nthree wives of king Daśaratha and\nmother of Bharata. [When Rāma was\nabout to be installed as heir-apparent,\nshe was not less rejoiced than Kausalya.\nBut she had a very wicked nurse called\nMantharā who long owed Rāma a\ngrudge. Finding this to be an excellent\nopportunity for her revenge, Mantharā\nso completely perverted the mind of\nKaikeyī that she became ready to ask\nthe king, as suggested by her nurse, to\ngrant her the two boons which he had\nformerly promised to her. By one of \n\nthese boons she asked for the \ninstallation of her son Bharata, and by the\nother for the banishment of Rāma for\nfourteen years. Daśaratha, blinded by\npassion as he was, severely scolded her\nfor her wicked demands, but was at last\nobliged to yield. On account of this\nwicked act her name has become \nproverbial for ‘a shrew’, or ‘Xanthippe’]."
