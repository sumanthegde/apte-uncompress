[He with his father fought on the side of the Pāṇḍavas, and for some days he acted as commander-in-chief of their forces. When Droṇa had killed Drupada after a hard struggle, Dhṛṣṭadyumna vowed that he would be revenged for the death of his father. And he was able to fulfil this vow on the morning of the 16th day of the battle, when he unfairly cut off the head of Droṇa; (see Droṇa). He was afterwards surprised by Aśvatthāman while lying asleep in the camp of the Pāṇḍavas, and was stamped to death.]. ",
