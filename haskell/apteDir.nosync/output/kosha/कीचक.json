[While Draupadī in the guise of Sairandhrī was residing at the court of king Virāṭa with her five husbands also disguised, Kīchaka once happened to see her, and her beauty stirred up wicked passion in his heart. He thenceforward kept a sinister eye on her, and endeavoured through the help of his sister, the king's wife, to violate her chastity. Draupadī complained of his unmannerly conduct towards herself to the king; but when he declined to interfere, she sought the assistance of Bhīma, and at his suggestion showed herself favourable to his advances. It was then agreed that they should meet at mid-night in the dancing hall of the palace. Pursuant to appointment Kīcaka went there and attempted to embrace Draupadī (as he fancied Bhīma to be owing to the darkness of night). But the wretch was at once seized and crushed to death by the powerful Bhīma]. ",
