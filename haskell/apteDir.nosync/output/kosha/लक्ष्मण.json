[He was so much attached to Rāma from his very childhood that he became ready to accompany him during his travels, and took no small part in the several events that took place during the fourteen years of Rāma's exile. In the war of Laṅkā he killed several powerful demons, but particularly Meghanāda, the most heroic of the sons of Rāvaṇa. He was at first mortally wounded by Meghanāda by means of a magical weapon, but was restored to life by Suṣeṇa by means of the medicinal drugs fetched by Māruti. One day Time in the disguise of a hermit came to Rāma and said that he who should happen to see them converse in private should be immediately abandoned, which was agreed to. Lakshmaṇa on one occasion intruded on their privacy and made the word of his brother true by throwing himself into the Sarayū; (see <ls>R. 15. 92-95</ls>). He married Ūrmilā by whom he had two sons Aṅgada and Candraketu.] --णा A goose. --णं {@--1@} A name, an appellation. {@--2@} A mark, sign, token.",
