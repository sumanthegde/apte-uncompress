[According to the Rāmāyaṇa she was the first woman created by Brahmā, who gave her to Gautama. She was seduced by Indra who assumed the form of her husband and so deceived her, or, according to another version, she knew the god and was flattered by the great God's condescension. There is another story which states that Indra secured the assistance of the moon who, assuming the form of a cock, crowed at mid-night. This roused Gautama to his morning devotions, and Indra went in and took his place. Gautama, when he knew of her seduction, expelled her from his hermitage and cursed her to be a stone and become invisible till she should be touched by the feet of Dāśarathi Rāma which would restore her to her former shape. Rāma afterwards delivered her from her wretched state and she was reconciled to her husband. Ahalyā is one of the five very chaste and pure women whose names every one is recommended to repeat in the morning; अहल्या द्रौपदी सीता तारा मंदोदरी तथा . पंचकन्याः स्मरोन्नित्यं महापातकनाशिनीः .. Kumārila Bhaṭṭa explains the seduction of Ahalyā as Indra's (the sun's) carrying away the shades of night, Ahalyā signifying night].
