[Having worshipped Dattātreya, he obtained from him several boons, such as a thousand arms, a golden chariot that went wheresoever he willed it to go, the power of restraining wrong by justice, conquest of earth, invincibility by enemies &c.; (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 6. 39</ls>). According to the Vāyu Purāṇa he ruled justly and righteously for 85000 years and offered 10000 sacrifices. He was a contemporary of Ravaṇa whom he once captured and confined like a beast in a corner of his city; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 6. 40.</ls> Kārtavīrya was slain by Paraśurāma for having carried off by violence the Kāmadhenu of his revered father Jamadagni. Kārtavīrya is also known by the name Sahasrārjuna.]. ",
