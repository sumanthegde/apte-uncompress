[He was born of Tārā, Vālī's wife, and is supposed to have been an incarnation of Bṛhaspati to aid the cause of Rāma (and hence noted for his eloquence). When, after the abduction of Sītā by Rāvaṇa, Rāma sent monkeys in all quarters to search for her, Aṅgada was made chief of a monkey-troop proceeding to the south. For one month he got no information, and, when consequently he determined to cast off his life, he was told by Sampāti that Sītā could be found in Laṅkā. He sent Māruti to the island and, on the latter's return with definite information, they joined Rāma at Kiṣkindhā. Afterwards when the whole host of Rāma went to Laṅkā Aṅgada was despatched to Rāvaṇa as a messenger of peace to give him a chance of saving himself in time. But Rāvaṇa scornfully rejected his advice and met his doom. After Sugrīva Aṅgada became king of Kishkindhā. In common parlance a man is said to act the part of Aṅgada when he endeavours to mediate between two contending parties, but without any success.]. {@--2@} <ab>N.</ab> of a son of Lakṣmaṇa by Urmilā (<ls>R. 15.</ls>90), his capital being called Aṅgadīyā. {@--3@} <ab>N.</ab> of a warrior on the side of Duryodhana.",
