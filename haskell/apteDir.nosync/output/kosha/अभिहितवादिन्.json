The {%anvitābhidhānavādins%} (the Mīmāṃsakas, the followers of Prabhākara) hold that words only express a meaning (अभिधान) as parts of a sentence and grammatically connected with one another (अन्वित); that they, in fact, only imply an action or something connected with an action; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} घटं in घटं आनय means not merely ‘jar’, but ‘jar’ as connected with the action of ‘bringing’ expressed by the verb. The {%abhihitānvayavādins%} (the Naiyāyikas, or the followers of Kumārila who hold the same doctrine) on the other hand hold that words by themselves can express their own independent meanings which are afterwards combined into a sentence expressing one connected idea; that, in other words, it is the logical connection between the words of a sentence, and not the sense of the words themselves, that suggests the import or purport of that sentence; they thus believe in a {%tātparyārtha%} as distinguished from {%vāchyārtha%}; see <ls>K. P. 2</ls> and Maheśvara's commentary {%ad loc.%} ",
