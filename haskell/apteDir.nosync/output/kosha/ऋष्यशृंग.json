According to mythical account he was born of a female deer, and had a small horn on his forehead, and hence called ‘Rishyaśṛṅga’, or ‘deerhorned’. He was brought up in the forest by his father, and he saw no other human being till he nearly reached his manhood. When a great drought well nigh devastated the country of Aṅga, its king Lomapāda, at the advice of Brāhmaṇas, caused Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to be brought to him by means of a number of damsels, and gave his daughter Śāntā (adopted by him, her real father being Daśaratha) in marriage to him, who being greatly pleased caused copious showers of rain to fall in his kingdom. It was this sage that performed for king Daśaratha the sacrifice which brought about the birth of Rāma and his three brothers]. ",
