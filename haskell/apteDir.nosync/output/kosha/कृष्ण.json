[Kṛṣṇa is the most celebrated hero of Indian mythology and the most popular of all the deities. Though the real son of Vasudeva and Devakī and thus a cousin of Kaṃsa, he was, for all practical purposes, the son of Nanda and Yaśodā by whom he was brought up and in whose house he spent his childhood. It was here that his divine character began to be gradually discovered, when he easily crushed the most redoubtable demons, such as Baka, Pūtanā &c., that were sent to kill him by Kaṃsa, and performed many other feats of surprising strength. The chief companions of his youth were the {%Gopīs%} or wives of the cowherds of Gokula, among whom Rādhā was his special favourite; (<ab>cf.</ab> Jayadeva's {%Gītagovinda%}). He killed Kaṃsa, Naraka, Keśin, Ariṣṭa and a host of other powerful demons. He was a particular friend of Arjuna, to whom he acted as charioteer in the great war, and his staunch support of the cause of the Pāṇḍavas was the main cause of the overthrow of the Kauravas. On several critical occasions, it was Kṛṣṇa's assistance and inventive mind that stood the Pāṇḍavas in good stead. After the general destruction of the Yādavas at Prabhāsa, he was killed unintentionally by a hunter named Jaras who shot him with an arrow mistaking him at a distance for a deer. He had more than 16000 wives, but Rukmi{%ni%} and Satyabhāmā, (as also Rādhā) were his favourites. He is said to have been of dark-blue or cloud-like colour; <ab>cf.</ab> बहिरिव मलिनतरं तव कृष्ण मनोपि भविष्यति नून <ls>Gīt. 8.</ls> His son was Pradyumna]. {@--8@} <ab>N.</ab> of Vyāsa, the reputed author of the Mahābhārata. {@--9@} <ab>N.</ab> of Arjuna. {@--10@} Aloe wood. {@--11@} The Supreme spirit. {@--12@} Black pepper. {@--13@} Iron. --ष्णा {@--1@} <ab>N.</ab> of Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas; <ls>Ki. 1. 26.</ls> {@--2@} <ab>N.</ab> of a river in the Deccan that joins the sea at Masulipattam. {@--3@} A kind of poisonous insect. {@--4@} <ab>N.</ab> of several plants. {@--5@} A grape. {@--6@} A kind of perfume. {@--7@} An epithet of Durgā. {@--8@} One of the 7 tongues of fire. --ष्णी A dark night. --ष्णं {@--1@} Blackness, darkness (moral also). {@--2@} Iron. {@--3@} Antimony. {@--4@} The black part of the eye. {@--5@} Black pepper. {@--6@} Lead. {@--7@} An inauspicious act. {@--8@} Money acquired by gambling.",
