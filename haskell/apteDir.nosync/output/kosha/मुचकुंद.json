[For having assisted the gods in their wars with the demons he got, as a reward, the boon of long and unbroken sleep. The gods also decreed that whosoever dared to interrupt his sleep should be burnt to ashes. When Kṛṣṇa wanted to kill the mighty Kālayavana, he cunningly decoyed him to the cave of Mucukunda, and on his entering it, he was burnt down by the fire which emanated from the king's eye]. ",
