In a sentence the अनुवाद्य or subject which is supposed to be already known is repeated to mark its connection with the विधेय or predicate and should be placed first; अनुवाद्यमनुक्त्वैव न विधेयमुदीरयेत्; in वृद्धिरादैच् आदैच् should have been placed first, though the construction is defended by Patañjali.
