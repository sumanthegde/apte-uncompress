(Originally there were only three {%Vedas%}: ऋग्वेद, यजुर्वेद and सामवेद, which are collectively called त्रयी ‘the sacred triad’; but a fourth, the अथर्ववेद, was subsequently added to them. Each of the {%Vedas%} has two distinct parts, the {%Mantra%} or {%Saṃhitā%} and {%Brāhmaṇa%}. According to the strict orthodox faith of the Hindus the Vedas are {%a-paurusheya%}, ‘not human compositions’, being supposed to have been directly revealed by the Supreme Being Brahman, and are called ‘Śruti’ {%<ab>i. e.</ab>%} ‘what is heard or revealed’, as distinguished from ‘Smṛti’, {%<ab>i. e.</ab>%} ‘what is remembered or is the work of human origin’; see श्रुति, स्मृति also; and the several sages, to whom the hymns of the Vedas are ascribed, are, therefore, called द्रष्टारः ‘seers’, and not कर्तारः or स्रष्टारः ‘composers’). {@--3@} A bundle of Kuśa grass; <ls>Ms. 4. 36.</ls> {@--4@} <ab>N.</ab> of Viṣṇu. {@--5@} A part of a sacrifice (यज्ञांग). {@--6@} Exposition, comment, gloss. {@--7@} A metre. {@--8@} Acquisition, gain, wealth (<ab>Ved.</ab>).
