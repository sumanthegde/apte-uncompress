He propitiated the god Brahmadeva by means of his penance on the Pāriyātra mountain, and asked as a boon that he should not be killed by any one except a child seven days old. On the strength of this boon he began to oppress the gods who were obliged to go to Brahmā and ask his assistance in the destruction of the demon; (see <ls>Ku. 2</ls>). But they were told that the offspring of Śiva could alone vanquish him. Afterwards Kārtikeya was born, and he slew the demon on the seventh day of his birth]. ",
