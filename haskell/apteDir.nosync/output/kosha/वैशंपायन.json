[It was he who made Yājñavalkya disgorge the whole of the Yajurveda he had learnt from him which was picked up by his other pupils in the form of {%Tittiris%} or partridges; and hence the Veda was called ‘Taittirīya’. Vaiśampāyana was celebrated for his great skill in narrating Purāṇas, and is said to have recounted the whole of the Mahābhārata to king Janamejaya]. ",
