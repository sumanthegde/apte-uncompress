[He was a son of Bāhu and was called {%Sagara%} because he was born together with {%gara%} or poison given to his mother by the other wife of his father. By his wife Sumati he had 60000 sons. He successfully performed 99 sacrifices, but when he commenced the hundredth, his sacrificial horse was stolen by Indra and carried down to the Pātāla. Sagara thereupon commanded his 60000 sons to search it out. Finding no trace of the animal on earth they began to dig down towards the Pātāla, and in doing this they naturally increased the boundaries of the ocean which was therefore called {%Sāgara%}; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 13. 3.</ls> Meeting with the sage Kapila they rashly accused him of having stolen their horse, as a punishment for which they were instantly reduced to ashes by that sage. It was after several thousands of years that Bhagīratha (<ab>q. v.</ab>) succeeded in bringing down to the Pātāla the celestial river Ganges to water and purify their ashes and thus to convey their souls to heaven].",
