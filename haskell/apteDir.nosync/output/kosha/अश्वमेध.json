A horse was turned loose to wander at will for a year, attended by a guardian; when the horse entered a foreign country, the ruler was bound either to submit or to fight. In this way the horse returned at the end of a year, the guardian obtaining or enforcing the submission of princes whom he brought in his train. After the successful return of the horse, the rite called Aśvamedha was performed amidst great rejoicings. It was believed that the performance of 100 such sacrifices would lead to the attainment of the seat or world of Indra, who is, therefore, always represented as trying to prevent the completion of the hundredth sacrifice].
