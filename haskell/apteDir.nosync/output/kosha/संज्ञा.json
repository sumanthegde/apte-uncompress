Resolved to carry out her purpose, she created, by means of her superhuman power, a woman exactly like herselfwho was, as it were, her own shadow (and was therefore called Chāyā), -and putting her in her own place, went away without the knowledge of the sun. Chāyā bore to the sun three children (see छाया), and lived quite happily with him, so that when Saṃjñā returned, he would not admit her. Thus repudiated and disappointed, she assumed the form of a mare and roamed over the earth. The sun, however, in course of time, came to know the real state of things, and discovered that his wife had assumed the form of a mare. He accordingly assumed the form of a horse, and was united with his wife, who bore to him two sonsthe Aśvinīkumāras or Aśvins <ab>q. v.</ab>]. ",
