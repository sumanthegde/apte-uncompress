[Nala, king of Niṣadha, entered into his service after he had lost his kingdom and suffered very great adversity. He was ‘profoundly skilled in dice’; and he exchanged with Nala this skill for his skill in horsemanship; and by virtue of it the king succeeded in taking Nala to Kuṇḍinapura before Damayantī had put into execution her resolve of taking a second husband].
