(It was originally divided into two systems:--the पूर्वमीमांसा or कर्ममीमांसा founded by Jaimini, and the उत्तरमीमांसा or ब्रह्ममीमांसा ascribed to Bādarāyaṇa; but the two systems have very little in common between them, the first concerning itself chiefly with the correct interpretation of the ritual of the Veda and the settlement of dubious points in regard to Vedic texts; and the latter dealing chiefly with the nature of Brahman or the Supreme Spirit.
