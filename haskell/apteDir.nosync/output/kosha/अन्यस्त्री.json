[In Rhetoric she is considered as one of three chief female characters in a poetical composition, the other two being स्वीया and साधारणी स्त्री. अन्या may be either a damsel or another's wife. The ‘damsel’ is one not yet married, who is bashful and arrived at the age of puberty. As ‘another's wife’ she is fond of festivals and similar occasions of amusement, who is a disgrace to her family and utterly destitute of modesty, see <ls>S. D. 108-110</ls>]. ",
