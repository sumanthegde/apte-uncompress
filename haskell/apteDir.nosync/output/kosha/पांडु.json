[He was begotten by Vyāsa on Ambālikā, one of the widows of Vichitravīrya. He was called Pāṇḍu, because he was born pale (पांडु) by reason of his mother having become quite pale with fear when in private with the sage Vyāsa; (यस्मात्पांडुत्वमापन्ना विरूपं प्रेक्ष्य ममिह . तस्मादेव सुतस्ते वै पांडुरेव भविष्यति <ls>Mb.</ls>). He was prevented by a curse from having progeny himself; so he allowed his first wife Kuntī to make use of a charm she had acquired from Durvāsas for the birth of sons. She gave birth to Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīma and Arjuna; and Mādrī, his other wife, by the use of the same charm, gave birth to Nakula and Sahadeva. One day {%Pāṇḍu%} forgot the curse under which he was labouring, and made bold to embrace Mādrī, but he fell immediately dead in her arms.]",
