(The word वरंडलंबुक in यदिदानीमहं वरंडलंबुक इव दूरमुत्क्षिप्य पातितः <ls>Mk. 1.</ls> is of doubtful meaning; it seems to mean ‘an over-hanging or projecting wall’, which, if raised high, is sure to topple down; so in the case of the Sūtradhāra whose expectations were raised very high only to be cruelly disappointed).
