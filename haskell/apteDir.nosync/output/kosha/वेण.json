[When he became king, he issued a proclamation prohibiting all worship and sacrifices. The sages strongly remonstrated with him, but when he turned a deaf ear to their words, they killed him with ‘blades of consecrated Kuśa grass.’ The kingdom was now without a ruler. So they rubbed the thigh of the dead body, until a Niṣāda came forth, short in stature and with a flat face. They then rubbed the right arm, and from it sprang the majestic Pṛthu (see Pṛthu). According to the Padma Purāṇa, Veṇa began his reign well, but subsequently fell into Jaina heresy. He is also said to have caused confusion of castes; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Ms. 7. 41</ls>, <ls n=\"Ms.\">9. 66-67</ls>.]. ",
