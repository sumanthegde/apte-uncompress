        "content": "--रथः <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated king of Ayodhyā, son of Aja, and father of Rāma and his three brothers. [He had three wives Kauśalyā, Sumitrā, and Kaikeyī, but was for several years without issue. He was therefore recommended by Vasiṣṭha to perform a sacrifice which he successfully did with the assistance of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. On the completion of this sacrifice Kausalyā bore to him Rāma, Sumitrā Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna, and Kaikeyī Bharata. Daśaratha was extremely fond of his sons, but Rāma was his greatest favourite -- ‘his life, his very soul’. Thus when Kaikeyī at the instigation of Mantha{%ra%} demanded the fulfilment of the two boons he had previously promised to her, the king tried to dissuade her mind from her wicked resolve by threats, and, failing these, by the most servile supplications. But Kaikeyī remained inexorable, and the poor monarch was obliged to send his beloved son into exile. He soon afterwards died of a broken heart]. ",
