[Dhruva is the polar star, but personified in mythology as the son of Uttāna. pāda. The account of the elevation of an ordinary mortal to the position of the polar star runs thus. Uttānapāda had two wives, Suruci and Sunīti, but the latter was disliked by him. Suruci had a son named Uttama, and Sunīti gave birth to Dhruva. One day the boy tried, like his elder brother, to take a seat in his father's lap, but he was contemptuously treated both by the King and his favourite wife. The poor child went sobbing to its mother who told him in consolatory terms that fortune and favour were not attainable without hard exertions. At these words the youth left the paternal roof, retired to the woods, and, though quite a lad, performed such rigorous austerities that he was at last raised by Viṣṇu to the position of the Polar Star]. --वं {@--1@} The sky, atmosphere. {@--2@} Heaven. --वा {@--1@} A sacrificial ladle (made of wood). {@--2@} A virtuous woman. {@--3@} A cow who stands still when being milked. --वं {%<ab>ind.</ab>%} Certainly, surely, verily; <ls>R. 8. 49</ls>; <ls>Ś. 1. 18.</ls>",
