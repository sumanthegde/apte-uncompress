[As the eldest son he was entitled to the throne, but being blind from birth, he renounced the sovereignty in favour of Pāṇḍu; but on his retirement to the woods, he undertook it himself, making Duryodhana-his eldest on-the virtual ruler. When Duryodhana was killed by Bhīma, the old king thirsted for revenge, and expressed his desire to embrace Yudhishṭhira and Bhīma. Kṛṣṇa readily discovered his object, and convinced that Bhīma was marked out by the King as his prey, he caused an iron image of Bhīma to be made. And when the blind king rushed forward to embrace Bhīma, Kṛshṇa substituted the iron image which the revengeful old man pressed with so much force that it was crushed to pieces, and Bhīma escaped. Thus discomfited, he, with his wife, repaired to the Himālaya and there died after some years]. ",
