[According to the Viṣṇu Purāṇa this monarch was, in a previous existence, the unrighteous Hiraṇyakaśipu, king of the Asuras who was killed by Viṣṇu in the form of Narasiṃha. He was next born as the ten-he added Rāvaṇa who was killed by Rāma. Then he was born as the son of Damaghoṣa, and continued his enmity to Kṛṣṇa, the eighth incarnation of Viṣṇu, with even greater implacability; (see <ls>Śi. 1.</ls>) He denounced Kṛṣṇa when they met at the Rajasuya sacrifice of Yudhiṣṭhira, but his head was cut off by Kṛṣṇa with his discus. His death forms the subject of a celebrated poem by Māgha]. ",
