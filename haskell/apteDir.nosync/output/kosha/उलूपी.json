While one day she was bathing in the Ganges, she happened to see Arjuna, and being enamoured of his handsome form, she managed to have him conveyed to her home, the Pātāla, and there induced him to take her as his wife, which he, after considerable hesitation, consented to do. She bore him a son named Irāvat. When Arjuna's head was cut off by Babhruvāhana's arrow, it was with her assistance that he was restored to life; see Arjuna]. ",
