[He was a very wise and powerful king, and when Indra lay concealed under waters to expiate the sin of having killed the demon Vṛtra, a Brāhmaṇa, he was asked to occupy his seat. While there he thought of winning the love of Indr{%ani%} and caused the seven sages to convey him in a palanquin to her house. On his way he asked each of them to be quick using the words {%‘sarpa’%}, {%‘sarpa’%} (move on, move on), when one of the sages (Agastya ?) cursed him to be a {%‘sarpa’%} (serpent). He fell down from the sky, and remained in that wretched state till he waś relieved from it by Yudhiṣṭhira]. ",
