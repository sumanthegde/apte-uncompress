        "content": "--काव्यं a great or classical poem; (for a full description of its nature, contents &c., according to Rhetoricians see <ls>S. D. 559</ls>) (The number of Mahākāvyas is usually said to be five:-- रघुवंश, कुमारसंभव, किरातार्जुनीय, शिशुपालवध and नैषधचरित, or six, if मेघदूत --a very small poem or खंडकाव्य --be added to the list. But this enumeration is apparently only traditional, as there are several other poems, such as the भट्टिकाव्य, विक्रमांकदेवचरित, हरविजय &c. which have an equal claim to be considered as Mahākāvyas) ",
