[Pṛthu was the son of Veṇa, son of Aṅga. He was called the first king, from whom the earth received her name Pṛthvī. The Viṣṇu Purāṇa relates that when Veṇa who was wicked by nature and prohibited worship and sacrifice, was beaten to death by the pious sages, and when consequently robbery and anarchy prevailed in the absence of a King, the Munis rubbed the right arm of the dead king to produce a son, and from it sprang the majestic Pṛthu, glowing like Agni. He was immediately declared King, and his subjects who had suffered from famine, besought the monarch for the edible fruits and plants which the earth withheld from them. In anger Pṛthu took up his bow to compel her to yield the supply so much needed by his subjects. She assumed the form of a cow and began to flee chased by the King. But she at last yielded and requested him to spare her life, and at the same time promised to restore all the needed fruits, plants &c., ‘if a calf were given to her through which she might be able to secrete milk’. Pṛthu thereupon made Svāyambhuva Manu the calf milked the earth, and received the milk into his own hand, from which proceeded all kinds of corn, vegetables, fruits &c., for the maintenance of his subjects. The example of Pṛthu was afterwards followed by a variety of milkers-gods, men, Ṛṣis, mountains, Nāgas, Asuras &c., who found out the proper milkman and calf from their own number, and milked the earth of whatever they wanted; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Ku. 1. 2</ls>]. --थु {%<ab>f.</ab>%} Opium",
