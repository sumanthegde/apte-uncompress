Ār. Up.</ls> {@--2@} An epithet of God. --तिः {%<ab>f.</ab>%} [न दातुं शक्तिः] {@--1@} Inability to give, poverty. {@--2@} [दातुं छेत्तुं अयोग्या] ({%a%}) The earth. ({%b%}) The goddess Aditi, mother of the Ādityas, in mythology represented as the mother of gods; see further on. ({%c%}) Freedom, security; boundlessness, immensity of space (<ab>opp.</ab> to the earth). ({%d%}) Inexhaustible abundance, perfection. ({%e%}) The lunar mansion called पुनर्वसु.

[अदिति literally means ‘unbounded’, ‘the boundless Heaven,’ or, according to others, ‘the visible infinite, the endless expanse beyond the earth, beyond the clouds, beyond the sky.’ According to Yāska अदितिरदीना देवमाता, and the verse beginning with अदितिर्द्यौः &c. <ls>Rv. 1. 89. 16</ls> he interprets by taking अदिति to mean अदीन {%<ab>i. e.</ab>%} अनुपक्षीण, न ह्येषां क्षयोस्ति इति. In the Ṛgveda Aditi is frequently implored ‘for blessings on children and cattle, for protection and for forgiveness’. She is called ‘Devamātā’ being strangely enough represented both as mother and daughter of Dakṣa. She had {8} sons; she approached the gods with 7 and cast away the 8th (Mārtaṇḍa, the sun.) In another place Aditi is addressed as ‘supporter of the sky, sustainer of the earth, sovereign of this world, wife of Viṣṇu’, but in the Mahābhārata, Rāmāyaṇa and Purāṇas, Vishṇu is said to be the son of Aditi, one of the several daughters of Dakṣa and given in marriage to Kaśyapa by whom she was mother of Viṣṇu in his dwarf incarnation, and also of Indra, and she is called mother of gods and the gods her sons, ‘aditinandanas’; See Dakṣa and Kaśyapa also].",
