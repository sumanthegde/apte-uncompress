The old Dvārakā stood near Madhupura 95 miles south-east of Dvārakā, and also near mount Raivataka, which appears to be the same as the Girinar hill near Junagad. Valabhi appears to have been the next capital of the country, the ruins of which were discovered at Bilbi 10 miles north-west of Bhownaggar. The celebrated lake Prabhāsa was situated in the same country and stood on the sea-coast. ",
