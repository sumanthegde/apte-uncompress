        "content": "जमदग्निः A Brāhmaṇa and descendant of Bhṛgu and father of Paraśurāma. [Jamadagni was the son of Ṛcīka and Satyavatī. He was a pious sage, deeply engaged in study, and is said to have obtained entire possession of the Vedas. His wife was Reṇukā who bore him five sons. One day when she had gone out to bathe, she beheld a loving pair of Gandharvas (according to some Citraratha and his queen) sporting and playing in the water. The lovely sight made her feel envious of their pleasure, and she returned defiled by unworthy thoughts, ‘wetted but not purified by the stream’. Her husband, who was anger incarnate, seeing her shorn of the lustre of her sanctity, furiously scolded her, and ordered his sons, as they came in, to cut off her head. But the first four sons shrank from that cruel deed. It was only Paraśurāma, the youngest, that with characteristic obedience to his father's command, struck off her head with his axe. The deed pacified the father's anger, and he desired Paraśurāma to ask a boon. The kind-hearted son begged that his mother might be restored to life which the father readily granted]. ",
