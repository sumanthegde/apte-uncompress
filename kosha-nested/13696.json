        "A son of Śyenī\nand Aruṇa, a semi divine bird.\n[He was a great friend of Daśaratha. \n\nHe once saved his life while he was\nthrown down along with his car by\nSaturn against whom he had proceeded\nwhen a drought, said to be caused by\nthe planet, well-nigh devastated\nthe earth. While Rāvaṇa was carrying\naway Sītā Jaṭāyu heard her cries in the\nchariot and fought most desperately\nwith the formidable giant to rescue her\nfrom his grasp. But he was mortally\nwounded, and remained in that state\ntill Rāma passed by that place in the\ncourse of his search after Sītā. The\nkind-hearted bird told Rāma that his\nwife had been carried away by \nRāvaṇa and then breathed his last. His\nfuneral rites were duly performed by\nRāma and Lakṣmaṇa]."
