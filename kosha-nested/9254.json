[She was\nthe daughter of the serpent Kauravya.\nWhile one day she was bathing in the\nGanges, she happened to see Arjuna,\nand being enamoured of his handsome\nform, she managed to have him \nconveyed to her home, the Pātāla, and there\ninduced him to take her as his wife, which\nhe, after considerable hesitation, \nconsented to do. She bore him a son named\nIrāvat. When Arjuna's head was cut\noff by Babhruvāhana's arrow, it was with\nher assistance that he was restored to\nlife; see Arjuna]."
