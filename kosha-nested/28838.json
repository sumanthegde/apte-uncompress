By his wife Sumati he had\n60000 sons. He successfully performed\n99 sacrifices, but when he commenced the\nhundredth, his sacrificial horse was\nstolen by Indra and carried down to\nthe Pātāla. Sagara thereupon \ncommanded his 60000 sons to search it out.\nFinding no trace of the animal on earth\nthey began to dig down towards the\nPātāla, and in doing this they \nnaturally increased the boundaries of the\nocean which was therefore called  \n{%Sāgara%}; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 13. 3.</ls> Meeting with the\nsage Kapila they rashly accused him\nof having stolen their horse, as a\npunishment for which they were \ninstantly reduced to ashes by that sage.\nIt was after several thousands of years\nthat Bhagīratha (<ab>q. v.</ab>) succeeded in\nbringing down to the Pātāla the \ncelestial river Ganges to water and purify\ntheir ashes and thus to convey their\nsouls to heaven]."
