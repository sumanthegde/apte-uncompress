        "{@--1@} <ab>N.</ab> of\na famous Apsaras or nymph of \nIndra's heaven who became the wife of\nPurūravas. [Urvaśī is frequently\nmentioned in the Ṛgveda; at her sight\nthe seed of Mitra and Varuṇa fell down,\nfrom which arose Agastya and Vasiṣṭha;\n(see Agastya). Being cursed by Mitra\nand Varuṇa she came down to the world\nof mortals, and became the wife\nof Purūravas, whom she chanced to see\nwhile descending, and who made a very\nfavourable impression upon her mind.\nShe lived with him for some time, and\nwent up to heaven at the expiration of\nher curse. Purūravas was sorely \ngrievved at her loss, but succeeded in \nsecuring her company once more. She bore\nhim a son named Āyus, and then left\nhim for ever. The account given in the\nVikramorvaśīyam differs in many \nrespects, where Indra is represented to\nhave favoured Purūravas with her \nlifelong company though he had himself\ncursed her. Mythologically she is said\nto have sprung from the thigh of the\nsage Nārāyaṇa, <ab>q. v.</ab>]. ",
