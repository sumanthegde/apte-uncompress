        "<ab>N.</ab> of a king of the \nPānchālas. [He was a son of Pṛṣata. He\nand Droṇa were school-fellows, as they\n\nlearnt the science of archery from Droṇa's\nfather, Bharadvāja. After Drupada had\nsucceeded to the throne, Droṇa, when in\npecuniary difficulties, went to him on\nthe strength of his former friendship,\nbut the proud monarch disrespected and\nslighted him. For this Droṇa afterwards\ngot him captured by his pupils the\nPāṇḍavas, but waś kind enough to spare\nhis life, and allowed him to retain half\nhis kingdom. But the defeat sustained\nby him at Droṇa's hands rankled in his\nsoul, and with the desire of getting a son\nwho would avenge the wrong done to\nhim, he performed a sacrifice, when a\nson named Dhṛṣṭadyumna (and a\ndaughter called Draupadī) sprang up\nfrom the fire. This son afterwards \ntreacherously cut off the head of Droṇa; see\nDroṇa also]."
