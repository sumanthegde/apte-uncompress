        "<ab>N.</ab> of a\ncelebrated Brāhmaṇa warrior and\ngeneral on the side of the \nKauravas, son of Droṇa and Kṛpī.\n[After the last great battle in which\nDuryodhana was mortally wounded,\nAśvatthāman, with two other surviving\nKauravas, entered the Pāṇḍava camp at\nnight, where he stamped Dhṛṣṭadyumna,\nthe slayer of his father, to death and \nkilled the five young sons of the Pāṇḍavas,\nkilling even Parīkṣit while yet in the\nmother's womb who was, however, \nrestored to life by Kṛṣṇa. The next \nmorning Draupadī clamoured for revenge \nupon the murderer of her children, but she\nconsented to forego her demand for his\nblood if the precious jewel he wore on\nhis head were brought to her. Bhīma,\nArjuna, and Kṛṣṇa overtook \nAśvatthāman and compelled him to yield the jewel\nwhich Yudhiṣṭhira afterwards wore\non his head. He is represented as a very\nbrave, fiery-tempered, young warrior, the\nembodiment of Brāhmaṇic and saintly \nlustre, and his altercation with Karṇa about\nthe nomination of a general to succeed\nDroṇa clearly brings out the chief \n\nfeatures of his character; see <ls>Ve. 3</ls>rd act.\nHe is one of the 7 {%Cirajīvins%} ‘ever\nliving persons’]."
