But the\nparents of the girl said that if their\ndaughter bore sons to the king, they\nwould not succeed to the throne, for \nafter his death Śantanava, being the \nrightful heir, would be the king. But \nŚāntanava, to please his father, made a vow\nto the parents that he would never \naccept the kingdom or marry a wife or\nbecome the father of children by any\nwoman, so that if their daughter bore a\nson to Śantanu, he would be the king.\nThis ‘dreadful’ vow soon became known\nabroad, and thenceforth he was called\n{%Bhīṣma%}. He remained single, and, \nafter the death of his father, he installed\nVicitravīrya, the son of Satyavatī, on \n\nthe throne, got him married to the two\ndaughters of king Kāśīrāja (see \nAmbikā), and became the guardian of his\nsons and grandsons, the Kauravas and\nPāṇḍavas. In the great war he fought\non the side of the Kauravas, but was\nwounded by Arjuna with the assistance\nof Śikhaṇḍin and was lodged in a ‘cage\nof darts’. But having got from his \nfather the power of choosing his own time\nfor death, he waited till the sun had\ncrossed the vernal equinox, and then gave\nup his soul. He was remarkable for his\ncontinence, wisdom, firmness of resolve,\nand unflinching devotion to God]. "
