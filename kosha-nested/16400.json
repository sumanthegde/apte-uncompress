Thus\naffected he played at dice with his\nbrother, and having lost everything,\nhe, with his wife, was banished from the\nkingdom. One day, while wandering\nthrough the wilderness, he abandoned\nhis wife, almost naked, and went away.\nSubsequently he was deformed by the\nserpent Karkoṭaka, and so deformed he\nentered the service of king Ṛtuparṇa of\nAyodhyā as a horsegroom under the name\nof Bāhuka. Subsequently with the \nassistance of the king he regained his \nbeloved, and they led a happy life; see\n{#ftuparRa#} and {#damayaMtI#} also]. ",
