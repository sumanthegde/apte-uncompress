        "<ab>N.</ab> of a king of the lunar\nrace, son of Āyus and grandson of\nPurūravas and father of Yayāti. \n\n[He was a very wise and powerful king,\nand when Indra lay concealed under\nwaters to expiate the sin of having \nkilled the demon Vṛtra, a Brāhmaṇa, he\nwas asked to occupy his seat. While\nthere he thought of winning the love\nof Indr{%ani%} and caused the seven sages to\nconvey him in a palanquin to her house.\nOn his way he asked each of them to\nbe quick using the words {%‘sarpa’%},\n{%‘sarpa’%} (move on, move on), when one\nof the sages (Agastya ?) cursed him to\nbe a {%‘sarpa’%} (serpent). He fell down from\nthe sky, and remained in that wretched\nstate till he waś relieved from it by\nYudhiṣṭhira]."
