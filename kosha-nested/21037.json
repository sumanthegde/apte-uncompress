[According to the \nPadmaPurāṇa, he was a Brāhmaṇa in his \nprevious existence, and when born as son\nof Hiraṇya-Kaśipu, he still retained his\nardent devotion to Viṣṇu. His father,\nof course, did not like that his own son\nshould be such a devout worshipper of\nhis mortal enemies, the gods, and with\nthe object of getting rid of him, he \nsubjected him to a variety of cruelties;\nbut Prahlāda, by the favour of Viṣṇu,\nwas quite unscathed, and began to\npreach with even greater earnestness\nthan before the doctrine that Viṣṇu\nfilled all space and was omni-present,\nomni-scient, omni-potent. \nHiraṇya-Kaśipu in a fit of exasperation asked him\n“If Viṣṇu is omni-present how do I\nnot see him in the pillar of this hall”?\nWhereupon Prahlāda struck the pillar\nwith his fist (according to another\naccount, Hiraṇya-Kaśipu himself \nangrily kicked the pillar to convince his\nson of the absurdity of his faith), when\nViṣṇu came out half-man and half-lion,\nand tore Hiraṇya-Kaśipu to pieces. \nPrahlāda succeeded his father, and reigned\nwisely and righteously.]"
