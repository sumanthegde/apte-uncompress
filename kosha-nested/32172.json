        "(also called {#Anarta#}) The modern peninsula of\nKattywar. Dvārakā is called {#AnartanagarI#} or {#abDinagarI#}.\nThe old Dvārakā stood near Madhupura 95 miles\nsouth-east of Dvārakā, and also near mount \nRaivataka, which appears to be the same as the Girinar\nhill near Junagad. Valabhi appears to have been\nthe next capital of the country, the ruins of which\nwere discovered at Bilbi 10 miles north-west of\nBhownaggar. The celebrated lake Prabhāsa was\nsituated in the same country and stood on the\nsea-coast."
