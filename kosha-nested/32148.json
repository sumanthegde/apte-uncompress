        "One of the seven principal chains of mountains\nin India. It is most probably to be identified with\nthe southern portion of the Ghāts running from\nthe south of Mysore, and forming the eastern\nboundary of Travancore. It is said by Bhavabhūti\nto be encircled by the river Kāverī (<ls>Mv. 5. 3</ls>,\nalso <ls>R. 4. 46</ls>), and is said to teem in cardamoms,\npepper, sandal, and betel-nut trees. In <ls>R. 4. 51</ls>\nKālidāsa calls the mountains Malaya and Dardura\n‘the two breasts of the southern region.’  \n{%Dardura%} is, therefore, that portion of the Ghāts,\nwhich forms the south-eastern boundary of \nMysore."
