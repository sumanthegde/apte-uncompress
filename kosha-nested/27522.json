        "<ab>N.</ab> of the daughter of \nViśvāmitra by the nymph Menakā who\nwas sent down by Indra to \ndisturb the sage's austerities. [When\nMenakā went up to the heaven she left\nthe child in a solitary forest where she\nwas taken care of by ‘Śakuntas’ or\nbirds, whence she was called \n“Śakuntalā”. She was afterwards found by\nthe sage Kaṇva and brought up as his \n\nown daughter. When Duṣyanta in the\ncourse of his hunting came to the sage's\nhermitage, he was fascinated by her\ncharms and prevailed on her to become\nhis wife by the Gandharva form of \nmarriage; (see Duṣyanta). She bore to\nhim a son named Bharata, who became\na universal monarch, and gave his name\nto India which came to be called \nBharatavarsha]."
