        "<ab>N.</ab> of a son of \nNighna and father of Satyabhāmā. [He\ngot the {%Syamantaka%} jewel from the sun\nand always wore it round his neck.\nHe afterwards gave it to his brother\nPrasena, from whom it passed into the\nhands of the monkey-chief Jāmbavat,\nwho got possession of it after having\nkilled Prasena. Kṛṣṇa, however, \novertook Jāmbavat and vanquished him in\nfight after a long struggle. The \nmonkeychief thereupon presented it along with\nhis daughter to Kṛṣṇa; see {#jAMbavat#}.\nKṛṣṇa then gave the jewel back to\nits proper owner Satrājit, who out of\ngratitude presented it along with his\ndaughter Satyabhāmā to him. \nAfterwards when Satyabhāmā was at her\nfather's house with the jewel, \nŚatadhanvan, at the instigation of a Yādava\nnamed Akrūra who desired the jewel\nfor himself, killed Satrājit and gave\nit to Akrūra. Śatadhanvan was \nafterwards killed by Kṛṣṇa, but when he\nfound that the jewel was with Akrūra,\nhe allowed him to retain it with \nhimself after having once shown it to the\npeople.]"
