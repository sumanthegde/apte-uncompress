        "<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated lake, which is considered to\nbe the same as the river Pennair, near which\nstands the Ṛṣyamūka mountain. The river is\nknown to rise from tanks; the northern part \nespecially from a stone tank in the centre of \nChanderdoorg. This was probably the original Pampā, and\nChanderdoorg the Ṛṣyamūka mountain. \nSubsequently the name was transferred from the tank\nto the river which rose from it."
