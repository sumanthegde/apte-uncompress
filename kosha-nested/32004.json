        "The celebrated author of the {#aBijYAnaSakuMtala#},\n{#vikramorvaSIya, mAlavikAgnimitra, raGuvaMSa, kumArasaMBava, meGadUta#}, \n{#ftusaMhAra#}; also of the poems {#nalodaya#} and of some other\nminor works. The earliest known authentic \nreference to Kālidāsa is in an inscription dated 556\nŚake or 634 <ab>A. D.</ab>, in which he and Bhāravi\nare spoken of as being renowned poets. The verse\nis as follows:--\n{#yenAyoji na veSma#}\n{#sTiramarTaviDO vivekinA jinaveSma .#}\n{#sa vijayatAM ravikIrtiH#}\n{#kavitASritakAlidAsaBAravikIrtiH ..#}\n<P>Bāṇa's reference to him in the beginning of his\nHarṣa-charita also shows that he must have \nflourished before the time of Bāṇa, {%<ab>i. e.</ab>%} before the\nfirst half of the seventh century. But how long\nbefore the seventh century the poet flourished\nis not yet known. According to Mallinātha's \nexplanation on <ls>Me. 14</ls> {#nicula#} and {#diNnAga#} were \ncontemporaries of Kālidāsa. If Mallinātha's \nsuggestion be correct-and it is very doubtful if it be\nreally so-then our poet must have lived in the\nmiddle of the sixth century which is the date\nusually assigned to {#diNnAga#}.\n<P>There is one point which, if definitely settled,\nwould give the poet's precise date. It is the\nmention by Kālidāsa of his patron Vikrama.\nWho this Vikrama is it has not yet been \ndefinitely settled. Popular tradition identifies him with\nthe founder of the Saṃvat Era which is said to\nhave commenced 56 <ab>B. C.</ab> If this view be \ncorrect, Kālidāsa must be considered as belonging\nto the first century before Christ. But some\nscholars have recently come to the conclusion\nthat what is called the era of Vikramāditya\n56. <ab>B. C.</ab> was a date arrived at by taking the date \n\nof the great battle of Korūr in which Vikrama\nfinally defeated the Mlecchas, {%<ab>i. e.</ab>%} 544 <ab>A. D.</ab>\nand then by throwing back the beginning of the\nnew era 600 years before that date, {%<ab>i. e.</ab>%} 56 B.\nC. If this conclusion be accepted as correct-and\nscholars do not seem to have yet agreed on the\npoint-Kālidāsa must have flourished in the sixth\ncentury <ab>A. D.</ab> The question is still an open one."
