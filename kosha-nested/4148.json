He was taught the use of\narms by Droṇa and was his favourite\npupil. By his skill in arms he won \nDraupadī at her Svayaṃvara (see Draupadī).\nFor an involuntary transgression he\nwent into temporary exile and during\nthat time he learnt the science of arms\nfrom Paraśurāma. He married Ulūpī, a\nNāga Princess, by whom he had a son\nnamed Irāvat, and also Citrāṅgadā,\ndaughter of the king of Maṇipura, who\nbore him a son named Babhruvāhana.\nDuring this exile he visited Dvārakā,\nand with the help and advice of Kṛṣṇa\nsucceeded in marrying Subhadrā. By\nher he had a son named Abhimanyu.\nAfterwards he obtained the bow Gāṇḍīva\nfrom the god Agni whom he assisted in\nburning the Khāṇḍava forest. When\nDharma, his eldest brother, lost the \nkingdom by gambling, and the five brothers\nwent into exile, he went to the \nHimālayas to propitiate the gods and to obtain\nfrom them celestial weapons for use in the\ncontemplated war against the Kauravas.\nThere he fought with Śiva who \nappeared in the disguise of a Kirāta; but when\nhe discovered the true character of his\nadversary he worshipped him and Śiva\ngave him the Pāśupatāstra. Indra,\nVaruṇa, Yama and Kubera also \npresented him with their own weapons. In\nthe 13th year of their exile, the \nPāṇḍavas entered the service of the King of\nVirāṭa and he had to act the part of a\ncunuch, and music and dancing master.\nIn the great war with the Kauravas \nArjuna took a very distinguished part.\nHe secured the assistance of \nKṛshṇa who acted as his charioteer and \nrelated to him the Bhagavadgītā when\non the first day of the battle he\nhesitated to bend his bow against his\nown kinsmen. In the course of the great\nstruggle he slew or vanquished several\nredoubtable warriors on the side of the \n\nKauravas, such as Jayadratha, Bhīṣma,\nKarṇa &c. After Yudhiṣṭhira had been\ninstalled sovereign of Hastināpura, he \nresolved to perform the Aśvamedha sacrifice,\nand a horse was let loose with Arjuna as\nits guardian. Arjuna followed it through\nmany cities and countries and fought with\nmany kings. At the city of Maṇipura\nhe had to fight with his own son \nBabhruvāhana and was killed; but he was \nrestored to life by a charm supplied by his wife\nUlūpī. He traversed the whole of Bharata\nkhaṇḍa and returned to Hastināpura,\nloaded with spoils and tributes, and\nthe great horse-sacrifice was then duly\nperformed. He was afterwards called\nby Kṛṣṇa to Dvārakā amid the intestine\nstruggles of the Yādavas and there he\nperformed the funeral ceremonies of\nVasudeva and Kṛṣṇa. Soon after this the\nfive Pāṇḍavas repaired to heaven having\ninstalled Parīkṣit-the only surviving\nson of Abhimanyu-on the throne of \nHastināpura. Arjuna was the bravest of the\nPāṇḍavas, high-minded, generous, \nupright, handsome and the most prominent\nfigure of all his brothers. He has several\nappellations, such as Pārtha, Guḍākeśa,\nSavyasācī, Dhanaṃjaya, Phālguna, \nKirīṭin, Jiṣṇu, Śvetavāhana, Gāṇḍīvin &c.\n&c.] ",
