        "<ab>N.</ab> of a king of the lunar\nrace, descendant of Puru, husband\nof Śakuntalā and father of Bharata.\n[Once upon a time Duṣyanta, while\nhunting in the forest, went to the \nhermitage of the sage Kaṇva, while \npursuing a deer. There he was hospitably\nreceived by Śakuntalā, the adopted\ndaughter of the sage, and her \ntranscendent beauty made so great an \nimpression on his mind that he prevailed on her\nto become his queen, and married her\naccording to the {%Gandharva%} form of \nmarriage. Having passed some time in her\ncompany the king returned to his \ncapital. After some months Śakuntalā was\ndelivered of a son, and her father thought\nit advisable to send her with the boy to\nher husband. But when they went and\nstood before Duṣyanta, he (for fear of\npublic scandal) denied all knowledge\nof having ever before seen or married\nher. But a heavenly voice told him\nthat she was his lawful wife, and he\nthereupon admitted her, along with\nthe boy, into his harem, and made her\nfirst queen. The happy pair lived to\na good old age, and committing the\nrealm to the care of Bharata, retired to\nthe woods. Such is the account of \nDuṣyanta and Śakuntalā given in the \n\nMahābhārata; the story told by \nKālidāsa differs in several important respects;\nsee “Śakuntalā.”]."
