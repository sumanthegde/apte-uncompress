In the \nṚgveda he and Vasiṣṭha are said to be the\noff-spring of Mitra and Varuṇa, whose\nseed fell from them at the sight of the\nlovely nymph Urvaśī at a sacrificial \nsession. Part of the seed fell into a jar and\npart into water; from the former arose\nAgastya who is, therefore, called \nKumbhayoni, Kumbhajanman, Ghaṭodbhava, \n\nKalaśayoni &c.; from the latter \nVasiṣṭha. From his parentage Agastya is\nalso called Maitrāvaruṇi, Aurvaśeya,\nand, as he was very small when he was\nborn, he is also called Mānya. He is \nrepresented to have humbled the Vindhya\nmountains by making them prostrate\nthemselves before him when they tried\nto rise higher and higher till they \nwellnigh occupied the sun's disc and \nobstructed his path, See Vindhya. (This fable\nis supposed by some to typify the \nprogress of the Āryas towards the south in\ntheir conquest and civilization of India,\nthe humbling of the mountain standing\nmetaphorically for the removal of \nphysical obstacles in their way). He is \nalso known by the names of Pītābdhi, \nSamudra-culuka &c., from another fable\naccording to which he drank up the\nocean because it had offended him and\nbecause he wished to help Indra and the\ngods in their wars with a class of demons\ncalled Kāleyas who had hid themselves\nin the waters and oppressed the three\nworlds in various ways. His wife was\nLopāmudrā. She was also called \nKauṣītakī and Varapradā. She bore him two\nsons, Dṛḍhāsya and Dṛḍhasyu. In\nthe Rāmāyaṇa Agastya plays a \ndistinguished part. He dwelt in a hermitage\non mount Kuñjara to the south of the\nVindhya and was chief of the hermits\nof the south. He kept under control the\nevil spirits who infested the south and\na legend relates how he once ate up a\nRākṣasa named Vātāpi, who had \nassumed the form of a ram, and destroyed by a\nflash of his eye the Rākṣasa's brother\nwho attempted to avenge him. In the\ncourse of his wanderings Rāma with his\nwife and brother came to the hermitage\nof Agastya who received him with the\ngreatest kindness and became his friend,\nadviser and protector. He gave Rāma the\nbow of Viṣṇu and accompanied him to\nAyodhyā when he was restored to his\nkingdom after his exile of 14 years. The\nsuperhuman power which the sage \npossessed is also represented by another\nlegend, according to which he turned\nking Nahuṣa into a serpent and \nafterwards restored him to his proper form.\nIn the south he is usually regarded as the\nfirst teacher of science and literature to\nthe primitive Dravidian tribes, and his\nera is placed by Dr. Caldwell in the 7th\nor 6th century <ab>B. C.</ab> The Purāṇas \nrepresent Agastya as the son of Pulastya (the\nsage from whom the Rākṣasas sprang)\nand Havirbhuvā the daughter of \nKardama. Several ‘hymn-seers’ are \nmentioned in his family, such as his two sons,\nIndrabāhu, Mayobhuva and Mahendra,\nalso others who served to \nperpetuate the family. The sage is \nrepresented as a great philosopher, \nbenevolent and kind-hearted, unsurpassed\nin the science of archery and to have\ntaken a principal part in the \ncolonization of the south; {#nirjitAsi mayA Badre#} \n{#SatruhastAdamarziRA . agastyena durADarzA muninA#} \n{#dakziReva dik ..#} <ls>Rām.</ls>; {#agastyAcaritAmASAM#} \n\n<ls>R. 4. 44</ls>; <ab>cf.</ab> also: {#agastyo#} \n{#dakziRAmASAmASritya naBasi sTitaH . varuRasyAtmajo yogI#} \n{#viMDyavAtApimardanaH ..#} and <ls>R. 6. 61</ls>, <ls>Mv. 7. 14.</ls>]"
