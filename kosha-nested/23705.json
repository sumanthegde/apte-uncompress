        "<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated\nking of the lunar race, son of \nNahusha; {#yayAtariva SarmizWA BarturbahumatA Bava#}\n<ls>Ś. 4. 6.</ls> [He married Devayānī,\ndaughter of Śukra, and Śarmiṣṭhā,\ndaughter of the king of Asuras, was\ntold by her father to be her servant as\na sort of recompense for her insulting\nconduct towards her on a previous \noccasion; (see Devayānī.) But Yayāti\nfell in love with this servant and \nprivately married her. Aggrieved at this\nDevayānī went to her father and \ncomplained of the conduct of her husband,\non whom, therefore, Śukra inflicted\npremature infirmity and old age. Yayāti,\nhowever, propitiated him and obtained\nfrom him permission to transfer his\ndecrepitude to any one who would \nconsent to take it. He asked his five sons,\nbut all refused except Puru, the \nyoungest. Yayāti accordingly transferred\nhis infirmity to Puru, and being once\nmore in the prime of youth, passed his\ntime in the enjoyment of sensual \npleasures. This he did for 1000 years, and\nyet his desire was not satisfied. At\nlast, however, with a vigorous effort he\nrenounced his sensual life, restored his\nyouth to Puru, and, having made him\nsuccessor to the throne, repaired to the\nwoods to lead a pious life and meditate\nupon the Supreme Spirit]."
