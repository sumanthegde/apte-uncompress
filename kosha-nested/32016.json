        "The well-known author of the Mahāvīracarita,\nMālatī Mādhava, and Uttararāmacarita. He was\na native of Vidarbha and lived at the court of king\nYaśovarman of Kānyakubja, who was subdued by\nLalitāditya of Kāshmir (693-729 <ab>A. D.</ab>) \nBhavabhūti flourished therefore at the end of the 7th\ncentury, and this date is consistent with Bāṇa's\nomission of his name. All anecdotes about the\ncontemporaneity of Kālidāsa and Bhavabhūti must\nbe rejected as absolute myths."
