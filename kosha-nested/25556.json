Bhavabhūti says that\nshe was betrothed by her father to king\nSaṃjaya, but that she offered herself to\nUdayana; (see <ls>Māl. 2</ls>). But the\nVāsavadattā of Subandhu has nothing in\ncommon with the story of Vatsa, except\nthe name of the heroine, as she is \nrepresented to have been betrothed by\nher father to Puṣpaketu, but carried off\nby Kandarpaketu. It is probable that\nthere were several heroines bearing the\nname Vāsavadattā.]."
