        "<ab>N.</ab> of a son of Arjuna\nby his wife Subhadrā, sister of \nKṛshṇa and Balarāma; also known by\nthe metronymic Saubhadra. [He\nwas called {%Abhimanyu%} because at his\nvery birth he appeared to be heroic, \nlongarmed and very fiery ({#aBivfdDaH#} \n{#manyuryasya#}). When the Kauravas at the advice\nof Droṇa formed the peculiar \nbattlearray called ‘Chakravyūha,’ hoping\nthat, as Arjuna was away, none of the\nPāṇḍavas would be able to break\nthrough it, Abhimanyu assured his \nuncles that he was ready to try, if they\nonly assisted him. He accordingly \nentered the Vyūha, killed many \nwarriors on the Kaurava side, and was for a\ntime more than a match even for such\nveteran and elderly heroes as Droṇa,\nKarṇa, Duryodhana &c. He could not,\nhowever, hold out long against fearful\nodds, and was at last overpowered and\nslain. He was very handsome. He had\ntwo wives, Vatsalā daughter of \nBalarāma and Uttarā daughter of the king\nof Virāṭa. Uttarā was pregnant when\nhe was slain and gave birth to a son\nnamed Parīkṣita who succeeded to\nthe throne of Hastināpura]."
