        "A king of the Solar\nrace, son of {#aMSumat#} and father of\n{#BagIraTa#}, but according to Kālidāsa,\nof {#raGu#}. [He is described by \nKālidāsa as a grand ideal of what a king\nshould be. His wife was Sudakṣiṇā,\na woman in every respect worthy of her\nhusband; but they had no issue. For\nthis he went to his family priest \n\nVasishṭha who told him and his wife to\nserve the celestial cow Nandinī. They\naccordingly served her for 21 days and\nwere on the 22nd day favoured by the\ncow. A glorious boy was then born\nwho conquered the whole world and\nbecame the founder of the line of the\nRaghus.]"
