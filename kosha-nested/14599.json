He propitiated the\ngod Brahmadeva by means of his \npenance on the Pāriyātra mountain, and \nasked as a boon that he should not be \nkilled by any one except a child seven days\nold. On the strength of this boon he\nbegan to oppress the gods who were \nobliged to go to Brahmā and ask his \nassistance in the destruction of the demon;\n(see <ls>Ku. 2</ls>). But they were told that\nthe offspring of Śiva could alone \nvanquish him. Afterwards Kārtikeya was\nborn, and he slew the demon on the\nseventh day of his birth]. "
