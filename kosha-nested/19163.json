        "The son of Budha and Ilā and\nfounder of the lunar race of kings.\n[He saw the nymph Urvaśī, while \ndescending upon earth owing to the curse of\nMitra and Varuṇa, and fell in love with\nher. Urvaśī, too, was enamoured of\nthe king who was as renowned for \npersonal beauty as for truthfulness, \ndevotion, and generosity, and became his\nwife. They lived happily together for\nmany days, and after she had borne him\na son, she returned to the heaven. The\nking heavily mourned her loss, and she\nwas pleased to repeat her visits five \nsuccessive times and bore him five sons.\nBut the king, who wanted her life-long\ncompany, was not evidently satisfied\nwith this; and he obtained his desired\nobject after he had offered oblations as\ndirected by the Gandharvas. The story\ntold in Vikramorvaśīya differs in many\nrespects; so does the account given in\nthe Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, based on a\npassage in the Ṛgveda, where it is said\nthat Urvaśī agreed to live with \nPurūravas on two conditions:--namely that\nher two rams which she loved as children\nmust be kept near her bed-side and \nnever suffered to be carried away, and\nthat he must take care never to be seen\nby her undressed. The Gandharvas,\nhowever, carried away the rams, and so\nUrvaśī disappeared]."
