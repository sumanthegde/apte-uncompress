        "The son of \nKṛtavīrya and king of the Haihayas, who\nruled at Māhiṣmatī. [Having \nworshipped Dattātreya, he obtained from\nhim several boons, such as a thousand\narms, a golden chariot that went \nwheresoever he willed it to go, the power of\nrestraining wrong by justice, conquest\nof earth, invincibility by enemies &c.;\n(<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 6. 39</ls>). According to the Vāyu\nPurāṇa he ruled justly and righteously\nfor 85000 years and offered 10000 \nsacrifices. He was a contemporary of\nRavaṇa whom he once captured and\nconfined like a beast in a corner of his\ncity; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 6. 40.</ls> Kārtavīrya was\nslain by Paraśurāma for having carried\noff by violence the Kāmadhenu of his\nrevered father Jamadagni. Kārtavīrya \n\nis also known by the name \nSahasrārjuna.]."
