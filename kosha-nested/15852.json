        "<ab>N.</ab> of the daughter of Drupada, \n\nking of the Pāñcālas. [She was\nwon by Arjuna at her \nSvayamvara ceremony, and when he and his\nbrothers returned home they told their\nmother that they had that day made\na great acquisition. Whereupon the\nmother said “Well, then, my dear\nchildren, divide it amongst yourselves.”\nAs her words once uttered could not\nbe changed, she became the common\nwife of the five brothers. When\nYudhiṣṭhira lost his kingdom and\neven himself and Draupadī in \ngambling, she was grossly insulted by \nDuhśāsana <ab>q. v.</ab> and by Duryodhana's\nwife. But these and the like insults\nśhe bore with uncommon patience and\nendurance; and on several occasions, when\nshe and her husbands were put to the\ntest, she saved their credit (as on the\noccasion of Durvāsas begging food at\nnight for his 60,000 pupils). At last,\nhowever, her patience was exhausted,\nand she taunted her husbands for the\nvery tame way in which they put up\nwith the insults and injuries inflicted\nupon them by their enemies; (see  \n<ls>Ki. 1. 29-46</ls>). It was then that the \nPāṇḍavas resolved to enter upon the great\nBhāratī war. She is one of the five\nvery chaste women whose names one is\nrecommended to repeat; see {#ahalyA#}]."
