He was\nalso noted for his medical skill.\n[This same Jāmbavat appears to have\nlived up to the time of Kṛṣṇa, or\nperhaps he was another being of that\ntime; for there was a fight between\nKṛṣṇa and Jāmbavat for the  \n{%Syamantaka%} jewel which the latter had got\nfrom Prasena, brother of Satrājit.\nKṛṣṇa vanquished Jāmbavat, who\nplaced the jewel, along with his \ndaughter Jāmbavatī, at his entire \ndisposal]."
