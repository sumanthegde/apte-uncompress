The sages\nstrongly remonstrated with him, but\nwhen he turned a deaf ear to their\nwords, they killed him with ‘blades of\nconsecrated Kuśa grass.’ The kingdom\nwas now without a ruler. So they \nrubbed the thigh of the dead body, until a\nNiṣāda came forth, short in stature\nand with a flat face. They then rubbed\nthe right arm, and from it sprang the\nmajestic Pṛthu (see Pṛthu). \nAccording to the Padma Purāṇa, Veṇa began\nhis reign well, but subsequently fell \ninto Jaina heresy. He is also said to\nhave caused confusion of castes; <ab>cf.</ab>\n<ls>Ms. 7. 41</ls>, <ls n=\"Ms.\">9. 66-67</ls>.]."
