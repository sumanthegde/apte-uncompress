        "<ab>N.</ab> of the daughter of\nBhīma, king of the Vidarbhas.\n[She was so called because by her\nmatchless beauty she subdued the \n\nride of all lovely women; <ab>cf.</ab>  \n<ls>N. 2. 18</ls>: --{#BuvanatrayasuBruvAmasO damayaMtI#} \n{#kamanIyatAmadaM . udiyAya yatastanuSriyA damayaMtIti#} \n{#tato'BiDAM daDO ..#}. A golden swan first\ndescribed to her the beauty and virtues\nof king Nala, and through him she\ncommunicated her love to Nala. \nAfterwards at a Svayaṃvara she chose\nNala for her husband from out of a\nhost of competitors among whom were\nthe four gods Indra, Agni, Yama, and\nVaruṇa themselves, and the lovely pair\nspent some years very happily. But\ntheir happiness was not destined to\nlast long. Kali, envious of the good\nfortune of Nala, entered his body,\nand induced him to play at dice\nwith his brother Puṣkara. In the\nheat of the play the infatuated\nmonarch staked and lost everything\nexcept himself and his wife. Nala and\nDamayantī were therefore driven out of\nthe kingdom, ‘clad in a single \ngarment’. While wandering through the\nwilderness, Damayantī had to pass\nthrough several trying adventures, but\nher devotion to her husband remained\nentirely unshaken. One day while she\nwas asleep, Nala in the frenzy of \ndespair abandoned her, and she was \nobliged to go to her father's house. After\nsome time she was united with her\nhusband, and they passed the rest of\ntheir lives in the undisturbed \nenjoyment of happiness. See Nala and \nṚtuparṇa also]."
