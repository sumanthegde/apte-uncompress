        "<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated\nking of Hastināpura, son of \nParīkshit, the grandson of Arjuna.\n[His father died, being bitten by a\nserpent; and Janamejaya, determined\nto avenge the injury, resolved to \nexterminate the whole serpent-race. He\naccordingly instituted a serpent \nsacrifice, and burnt down all serpents \nexcept Takṣaka, who was saved only\nby the intercession of the sage Āstīka,\nat whose request the sacrifice was \n\nclosed. It was to this king that  \nVaiśampāyana related the Mahābhārata,\nand the king is said to have listened\nto it to expiate the sin of killing a\nBrāhmaṇa.]."
