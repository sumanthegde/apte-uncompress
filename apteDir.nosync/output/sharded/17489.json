A few of the common\nNyāyas or popular maxims are here\ncollected for ready reference and \narranged in alphabetical order.\n<P>1. {#aMDacawakanyAyaH#} The maxim of\nthe blind man catching a sparrow,\nanalogous in sense to {#GuRAkzaranyAya#} <ab>q. v.</ab>\n<P>2. {#aMDaparaMparAnyAyaH#} The maxim\nof the blind following the blind.\nIt is used in those cases where \npeople blindly or thoughtlessly follow\nothers, not caring to see whether\ntheir doing so would not be a leap\nin the dark.\n<P>3. {#aruMDatIdarSananyAyaH#} The maxim \n\nof the view of the star Arundhatī.\nThe following explanation of \nŚankarāchārya will make its use\nclear: --{#aruMDatIM didarSayizustatsamIpasTAM#} \n{#sTUlAM tArAmamuKyAM prayamamaruMDatIti grAhayitvA tAM#}\n{#pratyAKyAya paScAdaruMDatImeva grAhayati#}.\n<P>4. {#aSokavanikAnyAyaH#} The maxim\nof the grove of Aśoka trees. \nRāvaṇa kept Sītā in the grove of Aśoka\ntrees, but it is not easy to account\nfor his preference of that particular\ngrove to any other one; so when\na man finds several ways of doing\na thing, any one of them may be\nconsidered as good as another, and\nthe preference of any particular\none cannot be accounted for.\n<P>5. {#aSmalozwranyAyaH#} The maxim of\nthe stone and clod of earth. A clod\nof earth may be considered to be\nhard as compared with cotton, but\nis soft as compared with a stone.\nSo a person may be considered to\nbe very important as compared with\nhis inferiors, but sinks into \ninsignificance when compared with his \nbetters. The maxim is also used to \ndenote the {%relative%} importance of two\nthings, though absolutely both may\nbe bad; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} {#gopAlaparaSurAmO uBAvapi atIva#}\n{#durmeDasO . kiMtu aSmalozwranyAyena gopAlaH#}\n{#paraSurAmAdvarIyAn#}. <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>Mar.</ab> {#‘dagaqApekzAM#}\n{#vIwa maU’#}. The maxim {#pAzARezwakanyAya#}\nis similarly used.\n<P>6. {#kadaMbakoraka(golaka)nyAyaH#}\nThe maxim of the Kadamba buds;\nused to denote simultaneous rise or\naction, like the bursting forth of\nthe buds of the Kadamba tree at one\nand the same time.\n<P>7. {#kAkatAlIyanyAyaH#} The maxim\nof the crow and the palm-fruit. It\ntakes its origin from the unexpected\nand sudden fall of a palm-fruit \nupon the head of a crow (so as to kill\nit) at the very moment of its\nsitting on a branch of that tree;\nand is used to denote a very \nunexpected and accidental occurrence,\nwhether welcome or unwelcome; <ab>cf.</ab>\n<ls>Candrāloka</ls>: --{#yattayA melanaM tatra lABo#}\n{#me yaSca suBruvaH .#} \n{#tadetatkAkatAlIyamavitarkitasaMBavaM ..#} also <ls>Kuvalayānanda</ls>: --{#patat#}\n{#tAlaPalaM yaTA kAkemopaBuktamevaM#} \n{#rahodarSanakzuBitahfdayA tanvI mayA BuktA .#} see  \n{#kAkatAlIya#} also.\n<P>8. {#kAkadaMtagavezaRanyAyaH#} The \n\nmaxim of searching after a crow's\nteeth, used to denote any useless,\nunprofitable, or impossible task.\n<P>9. {#kAkAkzigolakanyAyaH#} The maxim\nof the crow's eyeball. It takes its\norigin from the supposition that\nthe crow has but one eye (<ab>cf.</ab> words\nlike {#ekadfzwi, ekAkza#} &c.), and that it\ncan move it, as occasion requires,\nfrom the socket on one side into\nthat of the other; and the maxim\nis applied to a word or phrase which,\nthough used only once in a sentence,\nmay, if occasion requires, serve two\npurposes; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} {#dvIpo'striyAmaMtarIpaH#} \n{#ityatra astriyAmityasya kAkAkzigolakanyAyema#}\n{#aMtarIpaSabdenApyanvayaH#}.\n<P>10. {#kUpayaMtraGAwikAnyAyaH#} The \nmaxim of the buckets attached to the\nwater-wheel. It takes its origin\nfrom the fact that while some of\nthe buckets filled with water go up,\nsome are emptied of their contents,\nwhile others go down quite empty;\nand is used to denote the various\nvicissitudes of worldly existence;\n<ab>cf.</ab> --{#kAMScittucCayati prapUrayati vA#} \n{#kAMScinnayatyunnatiM kAMScitpAtaviDO karoti ca punaH#} \n{#kAMScinnayatyAkulAn .#} \n{#anyonyapratipakzasaMhatimimAM lokasTitiM boDayanneza krIqati#} \n{#kUpayaMtraGawikAnyAyaprasakto viDiH ..#} <ls>Mk. 10. 59.</ls>\n<P>11. {#GawwakuwIpraBAtanyAyaH#} The \nmaxim of day-break near a toll-station.\nIt takes its origin from the attempt\nof one (say, a cartman) who with\nthe intention of avoiding a toll\ntakes at night an unfrequented\nroad, but unfortunately finds \nhimself at day-break near that very \ntollstation, and is obliged to pay the\ntoll which he studiously tried to\navoid. Thus the maxim is used to\ndenote the occurrence of that which\none studiously tries to avoid; <ab>cf.</ab>\nŚrīharṣa: --{#tadidaM#} \n{#GawwakuwIpraBAtanyAyamanuvadati#}.\n<P>12. {#GuRAkzaranyAyaH#} The maxim of\nletters bored by an insect in wood.\nIt takes its origin from the \nunexpected and chance resemblance of\nan incision in wood or in the leaf\nof a book made by an insect to the\nform of some letter, and is used to\ndenote any fortuitous or chance \noccurrence.\n<P>13. {#daMqApUpanyAyaH#} The maxim of\nthe stick and cakes. When a stick \n\nand cakes are tied together, and one\nsays that ‘the stick has been \npulled down or eaten by a rat’, we are\nnaturally led to expect that\nthe cakes also have been \npulled down or eaten by the rat,\nas a matter of course, the two being\nso closely connected together; so,\nwhen one thing is closely connected\nwith another in a particular way,\nand we say something of the one, it\nnaturally follows that what we \nassert of the one can, as a matter of\ncourse, be asserted of the other;\n<ab>cf.</ab> --{#mUzikeRa daMqo BakzitaH ityanena#} \n{#tatsahacaritamapUpaBakzaRamarTAdAyAtaM BavatIti#} \n{#niyatasamAnanyAyAdarTAMtaramApatatItyeza nyAyo#} \n{#daMqApUpikA ..#} <ls>S. D. 10.</ls>\n<P>14 {#dehalIdIpanyAyaH#} The maxim\nof the lamp placed over the \nthreshold. It takes its origin from a\nlamp hanging over the threshold of\na house which, by its peculiar \nposition, serves to light the rooms on\nboth sides, and is used to denote\nsomething which serves a two-fold\npurpose at the same time.\n<P>15. {#nfpanApitaputranyAyaH#} The maxim\nof the king and barber's son. It is\nused to denote a man's innate \nfondness for his own \npossession-howsoever ugly or despicable in the\neyes of others. It takes its origin\nfrom a story which states that a\nking on one occasion asked his\nbarber to bring to him the finest boy\nthat he could see in his kingdom.\nThe barber roamed for a long time\nover every part of the realm, but\ncould discover no boy such as the\nking wanted. At last wearied and\ndisappointed, he returned home; and\nbeing charmed with the beauty\nof his own boy-who, to do him\njustice, was a personification of \nugliness and deformity-went to the\nking and presented the boy to him.\nThe king was at first very angry with\nthe barber for having trifled with\nhim, but on consideration excused\nhim, as he ascribed the barber's \npreference of his own ugly boy to the\ndominant desire of human beings\nto consider their own possessions\nas supremely good; <ab>cf.</ab> -{#sarvaH kAMtamAtmIyaM#}\n{#paSyati#} <ls>Ś. 2.</ls>\n<P>16. {#paMkaprakzAlananyAyaH#} The maxim \n\nof washing off the mud. Just as it\nis more advisable for one to avoid\ngetting into mud than to get into\nit and then wash it off, so it is\nmore advisable for one to avoid\ngetting into danger than to expose\noneself to it and then try to get out\nof it somehow or other; <ab>cf.</ab>  \n--{#prakzAlanAdDi paMkasya dUrAdasparSanaM varaM#}; and also \n“Prevention is better than cure”.\n<P>17. {#pizwapezaRanyAyaH#} The maxim of\ngrinding flour or meal, used to \ndenote a superfluous or unprofitable\nexertion like the attempt of a man\nto grind pounded flour; <ab>cf.</ab> {#kftasya#}\n{#karaRaM vfTA#}.\n<P>18. {#bIjAMkuranyAyaH#} The maxim of\nseed and sprout. It takes its origin\nfrom the relation of mutual \ncausation which subsists between seed\nand sprout, ({%seed%} being the cause\nof {%sprout%}, which in its turn is the\ncause of {%seed%}); and is used in those\ncases where two things stand to each\nother in the relation of both cause\nand effect.\n<P>19. {#lohacuMbakanyAyaH#} The maxim of\niron and magnet; it is used to\ndenote a very close affinity between\ntwo things, by virtue of which they\nare instinctively attracted towards\neach other, though at a distance.\n<P>20. {#vahniDUmanyAyaH#} The maxim of\nthe invariable concomitance of fire\nand smoke; (wherever there is\nsmoke there is fire.). It is used to\ndenote such invariable \nconcomitance between two persons or\nthings; ({%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} where there is A,\nthere is B; where there is not B,\nthere is not A.).\n<P>21. {#vizakfminyAyaH#} The maxim of\nthe worms bred in poison. It is used\nto denote a state of things which,\nthough fatal to others, is not so\nto those who being bred in it, are\ninured or naturalized to it, like\npoison which, though fatal to\nothers, is not so to the worms bred\nin it.\n<P>22. {#vizavfkzanyAyaH#} The maxim of\nthe poison-tree; used to denote\nthat a thing, though hurtful and\nmischievous, does not deserve to be\ndestroyed by the very person who\nhas reared it, just as even a \npoisontree ought not to be cut down by \n\nthe planter himself.\n<P>23. {#vIcitaraMganyAyaH#} The maxim of\na wave urging forward a wave. In\nthe ocean one wave propels another\ntill the first and all others in\nsuccession reach the shore. So this\nmaxim is used to denote successive\noperation, as in the case of the \nproduction of sound.\n<P>24. {#vfdDakumArIvAkya(vara)nyAyaH#}\nThe maxim of the old virgin's boon;\nthat is, asking such a boon as will\ncover all that one wishes to have.\nThe Mahābhāṣya says that an old\nvirgin, when asked by Indra to\nchoose a boon, said: --{#putrA me#} \n{#bahukzIraGftamodanaM kAMcanapAtryAM BuMjIran#}. This\none boon, if granted, would give\nher a husband, progeny, abundance\nof corn, cattle &c., and gold.\n<P>25. {#SAKAcaMdranyAyaH#} The maxim of\nthe bough and the moon. As the\nmoon, though considerably distant\nfrom the bough of a tree, is spoken\nof as ‘the moon on the bough,’ \nbecause she appears to be near it, so\nthis maxim is used when the \nposition of an object, though at a very\ngreat distance, is fixed by that of\nanother object to which it appears\nto be contiguous.\n<P>26. {#siMhAvalokananyAyaH#} The \nmaxim of the lion's backward glance.\nIt is used when one casts a \nretrospective glance at what he has left\nbehind, while at the same time he\nis proceeding, just as the lion, while\ngoing onward in search of prey, now\nand then bends his neck backwards\nto see if anything be within his\nreach; see under {#siMha#} also.\n<P>27. {#sUcIkawAhanyAyaH#} The maxim\nof the needle and the kettle. It is \n\nused to denote that when two\nthings-the one easy and the other\ndifficult-are required to be done,\nthe easier should be first attended\nto, as when one has to prepare a\nneedle and a kettle, he should first\ntake in hand a needle as it is an\neasier work compared with the \npreparation of a kettle.\n<P>28. {#sTAlIpulAkanyAyaH#} The maxim\nof the cooking-pot and boiled rice.\nIn a cooking-pot all the grains \nbeing equally moistened by the \nheated water, when one grain is found\nto be well cooked, the same may\nbe inferred with regard to the\nother grains. So the maxim is\nused when the condition of the\nwhole class is inferred from that of\na part; <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>Mar.</ab> ‘{#SitAvarUna BAtAcI#} \n{#parIkzA#}’.\n<P>29. {#sTURAniKanananyAyaH#} The \nmaxim of digging or fixing in the post.\nAs a stake or post to be firmly \nfixed in the ground is again and again\nmoved and thrust inward, so this\nmaxim is used when one (say, a \ndisputant) adds several corroborative\nillustrations, arguments &c. to\nstrengthen and confirm still more\nhis strong position.\n<P>30. {#svAmiBftyanyAyaH#} The maxim of\nmaster and servant. It is used to\nmark the relation of the feeder and\nthe fed, or the supporter and the\nsupported, subsisting between any\ntwo objects."
