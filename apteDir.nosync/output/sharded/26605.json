        "<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated sage. [He was\noriginally a Kṣatriya, being the king\nof Kanyakubja and son of Gādhi. One\nday while out hunting, he went to the\nhermitage of the great sage Vasiṣṭha,\nand seeing there the cow of plenty, \noffered him untold treasures in \nexchange for it, but being refused he\ntried to take it by force. A long \ncontest thereupon ensued, in which king\nViśvāmitra was signally defeated; and\nso great was his vexation, and withal\nso greatly was he impressed with the\npower inherent in Brāhmanism that he\ndevoted himself to the most rigorous\nausterities till he successively got the\ntitles {%Rājarṣi%}, {%Ṛṣi%}, {%Maharṣi%}, and\n{%Brahmarṣi%}, but he was not \ncontented till Vasiṣṭha himself called him by\nthe name {%Brahmarṣi%}, which, however,\ntook place after several thousands of\nyears. Viśvāmitra several times tried\nto excite Vasiṣṭha-for example by\nkilling his one hundred sons-but the\ngreat sage was not in the least \nperturbed. His power, even before he \nfinally became a Brahmarṣi, was very great,\nas was seen in his transporting \nTriśanku to the skies, in saving \nŚunahśepha from the hands of Indra, in\ncreating things after the style of \nBrahman &c. &c. He was the companion\nand counsellor of young Rāma to whom\nhe gave several miraculous missiles]."
