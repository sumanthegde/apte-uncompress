        "<ls>Uṇ. 4. 235</ls>; according to\n<ls>Ait. Br.</ls> {#aMgiras#} is from {#aMgAra; ye#} \n{#aMgArA AsaMsteMgiraso'Bavan#}; so <ls>Nir.</ls>; {#aMgArezu#}\n{#yobaBUva soMgirAH#} <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated sage to\nwhom many hymns of the Ṛgveda\nare ascribed. Etymologically Aṅgiras is\nconnected with the word Agni and is often\nregarded as its synonym ({#Sivo Bava prajAByo#}\n{#mAnuzIByastvamaMgiraH; aMgiroBiH fziBiH#} \n{#saMpAditatvAt aMgasOzWavAdvA aMgirA agnirUpaH#}). \nAccording to Bhārata he was a son of Agni. When\nAgni began to practise penance, Aṅgiras\nhimself became Agni and surpassed him\nin power and lustre, seeing which Agni\ncame to the sage and said:  \n--{#nikzipAmyahamagnitvaM tvamagniH praTamo Bava . BavizyAmi#}\n{#dvitIyohaM prAjApatyaka eva ca ..#} Aṅgiras said:\n{#kuru puRyaM prajAsargaM BavAgnistimirApahaH . mAM ca#}\n{#deva kuruzvAgne praTamaM putramaMjasA .. tacCrutvAMgiraso#}\n{#vAkyaM jAtavedAstaTA'karot#}. He was one of\nthe 10 mind-born sons of Brahmā. His\nwife was Śraddhā, daughter of Kardama\nand bore him {3} sons, Bṛhaspati, \nUtathya and Saṃvarta, and {4} daughters\nKuhū, Sinīvālī, Rākā and Anumati.\nThe Matsya Purāṇa says that Aṅgiras\nwas one of the three sages produced\nfrom the sacrifice of Varuṇa and that\nhe was adopted by Agni as his son and\nacted for some time as his regent. \nAnother account, however, makes him\nfather of Agni. He was one of the\nseven great sages and also one of the\n10 Prajāpatis or progenitors of mankind.\nIn latter times Aṅgiras was one of the\ninspired lawgivers, and also a writer on\nAstronomy. As an astronomical \npersonification he is Bṛhaspati, regent of \nJupiter or Jupiter itself. He is also \nregarded as the priest of the gods and\nthe lord of sacrifices. Besides Śraddhā\nhis wives were Smṛti, two daughters\nof Maitreya, some daughters of Dakṣa,\nSvadhā and Satī. He is also regarded\nas a teacher of the Brahmavidyā. The\nVedic hymns are also said to be his\ndaughters. According to the Bhāgavata\nPurāṇa, Aṅgiras begot sons possessing\nBrāhmanical glory on the wife of \nRathītara, a Kṣatriya who was childless\nand these persons were afterwards called\ndescendants of Aṅgiras. The principal \nauthors of vedic hymns in the family of \nAngiras were 33. His family has three distinct\nbranches {#kevalAMgirasa, gOtamAMgirasa#} and  \n{#BAradvAjAMgirasa#}, each branch having a number of\nsubdivisions. --(<ab>pl.</ab>) ",
