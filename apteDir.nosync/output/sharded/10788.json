        "<ab>N.</ab> of Skanda (so called because he\nwas reared by the six Kṛttikās).\n[Kārtikeya is the Mars or the god of\nwar of the Indian mythology. He is the\nson of Śiva (but born without the direct\nintervention of a woman). Most of his\nepithets have reference to the \ncircumstances of his birth. Śiva cast his seed\ninto Agni (who had gone to the god in\nthe form of a dove while he was enjoying\nPārvatī's company), who being unable\nto bear it cast it into the Ganges; (hence\nSkanda is called Agnibhū, Gaṅgāputra).\nIt was then transferred to the six \nKṛttikās (when they went to bathe in the\nGanges), each of whom therefore \nconceived and brought forth a son. But these\nsix sons were afterwards mysteriously\ncombined into one of extraordinary form\nwith six heads and twelve hands and eyes,\n(hence he is called Kārtikeya, \nShadānana, Ṣaṇmukha &c.). According to \nanother account the seed of Śiva was cast\nby the Ganges into a thicket of reeds\n(Śara); whence the boy was called \nŚaravaṇabhava, or Śarajanman. He is said\nto have pierced the mountain Krauncha,\nwhence his name Krauñcadāraṇa. He\nwas the commander of the army of the\ngods in their war with Tāraka, a powerful\ndemon <ab>q. v.</ab> whom he vanquished and slew;\nand hence his names Senānī and \nTārakajit. He is represented as riding a peacock.]\n"
