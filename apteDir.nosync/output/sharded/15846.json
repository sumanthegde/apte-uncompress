On the\nfifteenth day of the battle the fight\ncontinued even during the night, and it\nwas on the morning of the 16th that\nBhīma, at the suggestion of \nKṛshṇa, said within Droṇa's hearing\nthat Aśvatthāman was slain, (the\nfact being that an elephant \nnamed Aśvatthāman had fallen on the\nfield). Being at a loss to understand\nhow that could be, he appealed to\nYudhiṣṭhira, ‘the truthful’, who also,\nat the advice of Kṛṣṇa, gave an \nevasive reply-uttered loudly the word\nAśvatthāman and added ‘{%Gaja%} or\nelephant’ in a very low tone; see  \n<ls>Ve. 3. 9.</ls> Sorely grieved at the death of\nhis only son, the kind-hearted old\nfather fell in a swoon, and \nDhṛshṭadyumna, his avowed enemy, took \nadvantage of this circumstance, and cut\noff his head].
