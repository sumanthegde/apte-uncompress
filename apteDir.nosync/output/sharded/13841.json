        "<ab>N.</ab> of an ancient king, son\nof Suhotra, who adopted the river\nGaṅgā as his daughter. [The river\nGanges, when brought down from heaven\nby the austerities of Bhagīratha, was\nforced to flow over earth to follow him\nto the lower regions. In its course it \ninundated the sacrificial ground of king\nJahnu, who being angry drank up its\nwaters. But the gods and sages, and\nparticularly Bhagīratha, appeased his\nanger, and he consented to discharge\nthose waters from his ears. The river is\ntherefore regarded as his daughter, and\nis styled {#jAhnavI, jahnutanayA, --kanyA#},\n{#--sutA, naMdinI#} &c.; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 8. 95</ls>]."
