        "A Brāhmaṇa and \ndescendant of Bhṛgu and father of\nParaśurāma. [Jamadagni was the\nson of Ṛcīka and Satyavatī. He\nwas a pious sage, deeply engaged\nin study, and is said to have \nobtained entire possession of the Vedas. His\nwife was Reṇukā who bore him five sons.\nOne day when she had gone out to bathe,\nshe beheld a loving pair of Gandharvas\n(according to some Citraratha and his\nqueen) sporting and playing in the\nwater. The lovely sight made her feel\nenvious of their pleasure, and she \nreturned defiled by unworthy thoughts, \n‘wetted but not purified by the stream’. Her\nhusband, who was anger incarnate, \nseeing her shorn of the lustre of her \nsanctity, furiously scolded her, and ordered\nhis sons, as they came in, to cut off her\nhead. But the first four sons shrank\nfrom that cruel deed. It was only \nParaśurāma, the youngest, that with \ncharacteristic obedience to his father's \ncommand, struck off her head with his axe.\nThe deed pacified the father's anger, and\nhe desired Paraśurāma to ask a boon.\nThe kind-hearted son begged that his\nmother might be restored to life which\nthe father readily granted]."
