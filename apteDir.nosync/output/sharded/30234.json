        "{@--8@}\n<ab>N.</ab> of the wife of Satyavat, king\nof Śālva. [She was the only daughter\nof king Aśvapati. She was so lovely\nthat all the suitors that came to woo\nher were repulsed by her superior lustre,\nand thus though she reached a \nmarriageable age, she found no one ready\nto espouse her. At last her father\nasked her to go and find out a husband\nof her own choice. She did so, and\nhaving made her selection returned to\nher father, and told him that she had\nchosen Satyavat, son of Dyumatsena,\nKing of Sālva, who being driven out\nfrom his kingdom was then leading a\nhermit's life along with his wife. When\nNārada, who happened to be present\nthere, heard this, he told her as well\nas Aśvapati that he was very sorry\nto hear of the choice she had made,\nfor though Satyavat was in every way\nworthy of her, yet he was fated to\ndie in a year from that date, and in\nchoosing him, therefore, Sāvitrī would\nbe only choosing life-long widow-hood\nand misery. Her parents, therefore,\nnaturally tried to dissuade her mind,\nbut the high-souled maiden told them\nthat her choice was unalterably fixed.\nAccordingly the marriage took place\nin due time, and Sāvitrī laid aside her\njewels and rich apparel, and putting\non the coarse garments of hermits, spent\nher time in serving her old father and\nmother-in-law. Still, though \noutwardly happy, she could not forget the\nwords of Nārada, and as she counted,\nthe days seemed to fly swiftly like \nmoments, and the fated time, when her\nhusband was to die, drew near. ‘I\nhave yet three days’, thought she,\n‘and for these three days I shall\nobserve a rigid fast.’ She maintained\nher vow, and on the fourth day, when\nSatyavat was about to go to the woods\nto bring sacrificial fuel, she \naccompanied him. After having collected\nsome fuel, Satyavat, being fatigued, sat\ndown, and reposing his head on the\nbosom of Sāvitrī fell asleep. Just\nthen Yama came down, snatched off\nhis soul, and proceeded towards the\nsouth. Sāvitrī saw this and followed\nthe god who told her to return as\nher husband's term of life was over.\nBut the faithful wife besought Yama\nin so pathetic a strain that he granted\nher boon after boon, except the life\nof her husband, until, being quite \nsubdued by her devotion to her husband\nand the force of her eloquent appeal, the\ngod relented and restored even the \nspirit of Satyavat to her. Delighted she\nreturned, and found her husband as\nif roused from a deep sleep, and \ninforming him of all that had occurred, \n\nwent to the hermitage of her \nfatherin-law who soon reaped the fruits of\nthe boons of Yama. Sāvitri is \nregarded as the {%beau ideal%} or highest\npattern of conjugal fidelity, and a\nyoung married woman is usually \nblessed by elderly females with the words\n{#janmasAvitrI Bava#}, thus placing before her\nthe example of Sāvitrī for lifelong \nimitation].
