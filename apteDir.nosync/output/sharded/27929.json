In due\ncourse she was married to the daughter\nof Hiraṇyavarman, who was extremely\nsorry to find that she had got a veritable\nwoman for her husband. Her father,\ntherefore, resolved to attack the kingdom\nof Drupada for his having deceived him;\nbut Śikhaṇḍin contrived, by \npractising austere penance in a forest, to \nexchange her sex with a Yakṣa, and thus\naverted the calamity which threatened\nDrupada. Afterwards in the great \nBhāratī war he proved a means of killing \nBhīshma, who declined to fight with a \nwoman, when Arjuna put him forward as\nhis hero.
