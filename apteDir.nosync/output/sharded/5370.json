        "<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated Brāhmaṇa,\nson of the great sage Kahoḍa.\n[Kahoḍa married a daughter of his \n\npreceptor Uddālaka, but he was so \ndevoted to study that he generally neglected\nher. When once she was far advanced in\npregnancy, the unborn son was \nprovoked at his father's neglect of her and \nrebuked him for his absorption in study\nto the neglect even of his wife. The\nsage was very angry at this \nimpertinence and condemned him to be born\ncrooked; so he came forth with his\neight (ashṭa) limbs crooked (vakra);\nwhence his name; {#yasmAtkukzO vartamAno bravIzi#}\n{#tasmAdvakro BavitAsyazwakftvaH#} <ls>Mb.</ls> When \nKahoḍa was drowned into a river as the\nresult of a wager in a dispute with a \nBuddhist, young Ashṭāvakra defeated the\nsage and delivered his father, who,\nbeing pleased, directed his son to bathe\ninto the Samaṅgā river, on doing which\nthe lad became perfectly straight]."
