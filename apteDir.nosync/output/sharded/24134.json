He is called\n{%Paulastya%} as being a grandson of the\nsage Pulastya. Laṅkā was originally\noccupied by Kubera, but Rāvaṇa ousted\nhim from it and made it his own \ncapital. He had ten heads (and hence his\nnames Daśagrīva, Daśavadana &c.)\nand twenty arms, and according to\nsome, four legs (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 12. 88</ls> and\n<ls>Malli.</ls>). He is represented to have\npractised the most austere penance\nfor ten thousand years in order to\npropitiate the god Brahman, and to\nhave offered one head at the end of\neach one thousand years. Thus he offered\nnine of his heads and was going to offer\nthe tenth when the God was pleased\nand granted him immunity from death\nby either god or man. On the strength\nof this boon he grew very tyrannical\nand oppressed all beings. His power\nbecame so great that even the gods are\nsaid to have acted as his domestic \nservanta. He conquered almost all the\nkings of the day, but is said to have\nbeen imprisoned by Kārtavīrya for \n\nsome time when he went to attack his\nterritory. On one occasion he tried to\nuplift the Kailāsa mountain, but Śiva\npressed it down so as to crush his \nfingers under it. He, therefore, hymned\nŚiva for one thousand years so loudly\nthat the God gave him the name {%Rāvaṇa%}\nand freed him from his painful position.\nBut though he was so powerful and \ninvincible, the day of retribution drew\nnear. While Rāma-who was Viṣṇu\ndescended on earth for the destruction\nof this very demon-was passing his\nyears of exile in the forest, Rāvaṇa\ncarried off his wife Sitā and urged her\nto become his wife; but she persistently\nrefused and remained loyal to her \nhusband. At last Rāma assisted by his\nmonkey-troops invaded Laṅkā, \nannihilated Rāvaṇa's troops and killed the\ndemon himself. He was a worthy \nopponent of Rāma, and hence the \nexpression:-- {#rAmarAvaRayoryudDaM rAmarAvaRayoriva#}].\n"
