[Aniruddha was the son of Kāma and grandson of Kṛṣṇa. Uṣā, the daughter of a demon named Bāṇa, fell in love with him and had him brought by magic influence to her apartments in her father's city of Śoṇitapura. Bāṇa sent some guards to seize him, but the brave youth slew his assailants with only an iron club. At last, however, he was secured by means of magic powers. On discovering where Aniruddha had been carried, Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma and Kāma went to rescue him and a great battle was fought. Bāṇa, though aided by Śiva and Skanda, was vanquished, but his life was spared at the intercession of Śiva, and Aniruddha was carried home to Dvārakā with Uṣā as his wife. He had also another wife Rochanā, grand-daughter of king Rukmin of Vidarbha, who bore him a son named Vajra.]. {@--3@} Also <ab>N.</ab> of Viṣṇu; and of Śiva; of an Arhat, a contemporary of Buddha. --द्धं A cord or rope (for fastening cattle)."
