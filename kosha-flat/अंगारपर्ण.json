[On one occasion, while he was sporting with his wife, he saw Kuntī with her five sons proceeding to the capital of Pāñcāla in disguise. He accosted them and asked them to tell him where they were going, or to fight. Arjuna accepted the challenge; but Aṅgāraparṇa finding Arjuna to be a very skilful warrior gave him a secret lore called chākshushī (enabling one to see the smallest things) and took from him in return a lore called Agniśirāstra and became a friend of the Pāṇḍavas.]"
