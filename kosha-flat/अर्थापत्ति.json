        "content": "--आपत्तिः {%<ab>f.</ab>%} [अर्थस्य अनुक्तार्थस्य आपात्तिः सिद्धिः] {1} an inference from circumstances, presumption, implication, one of the five sources of knowledge or modes of proof, according to the Mīmāṃsakas. It is ‘deduction of a matter from that which could not else be’; it is ‘assumption of a thing, not itself perceived but necessarily implied by another which is seen, heard, or proved’; it is an inference used to account for an apparent inconsistency; as in the familiar instance पीनो देवदत्तो दिवा न भुक्तें the apparent inconsistency between ‘fatness’ and ‘not eating by day’ is accounted for by the inference of his ‘eating by night’; पीनत्वविशिष्टस्य देवदत्तस्य रात्रिभोजित्वरूपार्थस्य शब्दानुक्तस्यापि आपत्तिः. Strictly speaking it is no separate mode of proof; it is only a case of अनुमान and can be proved by a व्यतिरेकव्याप्ति; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Tarka K. 17</ls> and <ls>S. D. 460.</ls> {2} a figure of speech (according to some rhetoricians) in which a relevant assertion suggests an inference not actually connected with the subject in hand, or {%vice versa%}; it corresponds to what is popularly called कैमुतिकन्याय or दंडापूपन्याय; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} हारोयं हरिणाक्षीणां लुठति स्तनमंडले . मुक्तानामप्यवस्थेयं के वयं स्मरकिंकराः <ls>Amaru. 100</ls>; अभितप्तमयोपि मार्दवं भजते कैव कथा शरीरिषु <ls>R. 8. 43.</ls> <ls>S. D.</ls> thus defines the figure: --दंडापूपिकयान्यार्थागमोऽ र्थापत्तिरिष्यते. "
