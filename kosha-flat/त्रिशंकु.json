        "content": "--शंकुः {1} <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated king of the Solar race, king of Ayodhyā and father of Hariśchandra. [He was a wise, pious, and just king, but his chief fault was that he loved his person to an inordinate degree. Desiring to celebrate a sacrifice by virtue of which he could go up to heaven in his mortal body, he requested his family-priest Vasiṣṭha to officiate for him; but being refused he next requested his hundred sons who also rejected his absurd proposal. He, therefore, called them cowardly and impotent, and was, in return for these insults, cursed and degraded by them to be a Chāṇḍāla. While he was in this wretched condition, Viśvāmitra, whose family Triśaṅku had in times of famine laid under deep obligations, undertook to celebrate the sacrifice, and invited all the gods to be present. They, however, declined; whereupon the enraged Viśvāmitra by his own power lifted up Triśaṅku to the skies with his cherished mortal body. He began to soar higher and higher till his head struck against the vault of the heaven, when he was hurled down headforemost by Indra and the other gods. The mighty Viśvāmitra, however, arrested him in his downward course, saying ‘Stay Triśaṅku’, and the unfortunate monarch remained suspended with his head towards the earth as a constellation in the southern hemisphere. Hence the well-known proverb; त्रिशंकुरिवांतरा तिष्ठ <ls>Ś. 2</ls>]. {2} the Cātaka bird. {3} a cat. {4} a grass-hopper. {5} a fire-fly. "
