        "content": "दिलीपः A king of the Solar race, son of अंशुमत् and father of भगीरथ, but according to Kālidāsa, of रघु. [He is described by Kālidāsa as a grand ideal of what a king should be. His wife was Sudakṣiṇā, a woman in every respect worthy of her husband; but they had no issue. For this he went to his family priest Vasishṭha who told him and his wife to serve the celestial cow Nandinī. They accordingly served her for 21 days and were on the 22nd day favoured by the cow. A glorious boy was then born who conquered the whole world and became the founder of the line of the Raghus.] "
