[He is represented as a very powerful monkey, and is said to have placed under his arm-pit even Rāvaṇa when he went to fight with him. During his absence from Kiṣkindhā to slay the brother of Dundubhi, Sugrīva usurped the throne considering him to be dead, but when Vāli returned, he had to run away to Ṛṣyamūka. Tārā, wife of Sugrīva, was seized by Vāli, but she was restored to her husband when Rāma slew him.] "
