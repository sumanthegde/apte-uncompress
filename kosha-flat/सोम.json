[In mythology, the moon is represented as having sprung from the eye of the sage Atri; (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 2. 75</ls>); or as produced from the sea at the time of churning. The twenty-seven asterisms-mythologically represented as so many daughters of Dakṣa <ab>q. v.</ab>-- are said to be his wives. The phenomenon of the periodical waning of the moon is explained by a myth which states that his nectarous digits are drunk up by different gods in regular rotation, or by the invention of another legend which says that the moon, on account of his particular fondness and partiality for Rohiṇi, one of the 27 daughters of Dakṣa, was cursed by his father-inlaw to be consumptive, but that at the intercession of his wives the sentence of eternal consumption was commuted to one of periodical consumption. Soma is also represented as having carried off Tārā, the wife of Bṛhaspati, by whom he had a son named Budha, who afterwards became the founder of the lunar race of kings; see Tārā ({%b%}) also]. {@--5@} A ray of light. {@--6@} Camphor. {@--7@} Water. {@--8@} Air, wind. {@--9@} <ab>N.</ab> of Kubera. {@--10@} Of Śiva. {@--11@} Of Yama. {@--12@} <ab>N.</ab> of Sugrīva. {@--13@} (As the last member of <ab>comp.</ab>) Chief, principal, best; as in नृसोम <ab>q. v.</ab> --मं {@--1@} Ricegruel. {@--2@} Sky, heaven."
