[According to Vedic conception they are the harbingers of Uṣas or the dawn; they are young, beautiful, bright, swift &c.; and, according to Yāska, they represent the transition from darkness to light, when the intermingling of both produces that inseparable duality expressed by the twin nature of these deities; according to different interpretations quoted in the Nirukta they were ‘heaven and earth’, ‘day and night’, ‘two kings, performers of holy acts’ which may be traced to their dual and luminous nature. Mythically they were the parents of Nakula and Sahadeva and the physicians of the gods and are called {%Gadāgadau%}, {%Svarvaidyau%}, {%Dasrau%}, {%Nāsatyau%}, {%Vādaveyau%}, {%Abdhijau%} &c.
