[He was begotten on Kuntī by the god Wind From a child he showed that he was possessed of extraordinary strength and hence he was called Bhīma. He had <P>° a most voracious appetite, and was called Vṛkodara, or ‘wolf-bellied’. His most effective weapon was his mace. He played a very important part in the great war, and, on the last day of the battle, smashed the thigh of Duryodhana with his unfailing mace. Some of the principal events of his earlier life are his defeat of the Demons Hiḍimba and Baka, the overthrow of Jarāsaṃdha, the fearful vow which he uttered against the Kauravas and particularly against Duhśāsana for his insulting conduct towards Draupadī, the fulfilment of that vow by drinking Duḥśāsana's blood, the defeat of Jayadratha, his duel with Kīchaka while he was serving as headcook to king Virāṭa, and several other exploits in which he showed his usual extraordinary strength. His name has become proverbial for one who possesses immense strength and courage]. --मं Horror, terror."
