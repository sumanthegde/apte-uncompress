[When Menakā went up to the heaven she left the child in a solitary forest where she was taken care of by ‘Śakuntas’ or birds, whence she was called “Śakuntalā”. She was afterwards found by the sage Kaṇva and brought up as his own daughter. When Duṣyanta in the course of his hunting came to the sage's hermitage, he was fascinated by her charms and prevailed on her to become his wife by the Gandharva form of marriage; (see Duṣyanta). She bore to him a son named Bharata, who became a universal monarch, and gave his name to India which came to be called Bharatavarsha]. "
