[He was brave and warlike, but wicked and intractable. When Yudhishṭhira staked and lost even Draupadī, Duḥśāsana dragged her into the assembly by her hair and began to strip her of every clothing; but Kṛṣṇa, ever ready to help the distressed, covered her from shame and ignominy. Bhīma was so much exasperated at this dastardly act of Duḥśāsana that he vowed in the assembly that he would not rest till he had drunk the villain's blood. On the 16th day of the great war Bhīma encountered Duhśāsana in a single combat, killed him with ease, and drank, according to his resolution, his blood to his heart's content]."
