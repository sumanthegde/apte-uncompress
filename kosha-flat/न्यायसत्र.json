        "content": "--सत्रं the aphorisms of Nyāya philosophy by Gautama. <P>{%Note%}. A few of the common Nyāyas or popular maxims are here collected for ready reference and arranged in alphabetical order. <P>1. अंधचटकन्यायः The maxim of the blind man catching a sparrow, analogous in sense to घुणाक्षरन्याय <ab>q. v.</ab> <P>2. अंधपरंपरान्यायः The maxim of the blind following the blind. It is used in those cases where people blindly or thoughtlessly follow others, not caring to see whether their doing so would not be a leap in the dark. <P>3. अरुंधतीदर्शनन्यायः The maxim of the view of the star Arundhatī. The following explanation of Śankarāchārya will make its use clear: --अरुंधतीं दिदर्शयिषुस्तत्समीपस्थां स्थूलां ताराममुख्यां प्रयममरुंधतीति ग्राहयित्वा तां प्रत्याख्याय पश्चादरुंधतीमेव ग्राहयति. <P>4. अशोकवनिकान्यायः The maxim of the grove of Aśoka trees. Rāvaṇa kept Sītā in the grove of Aśoka trees, but it is not easy to account for his preference of that particular grove to any other one; so when a man finds several ways of doing a thing, any one of them may be considered as good as another, and the preference of any particular one cannot be accounted for. <P>5. अश्मलोष्ट्रन्यायः The maxim of the stone and clod of earth. A clod of earth may be considered to be hard as compared with cotton, but is soft as compared with a stone. So a person may be considered to be very important as compared with his inferiors, but sinks into insignificance when compared with his betters. The maxim is also used to denote the {%relative%} importance of two things, though absolutely both may be bad; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} गोपालपरशुरामौ उभावपि अतीव दुर्मेधसौ . किंतु अश्मलोष्ट्रन्यायेन गोपालः परशुरामाद्वरीयान्. <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>Mar.</ab> ‘दगडापेक्षां वीट मऊ’. The maxim पाषाणेष्टकन्याय is similarly used. <P>6. कदंबकोरक(गोलक)न्यायः The maxim of the Kadamba buds; used to denote simultaneous rise or action, like the bursting forth of the buds of the Kadamba tree at one and the same time. <P>7. काकतालीयन्यायः The maxim of the crow and the palm-fruit. It takes its origin from the unexpected and sudden fall of a palm-fruit upon the head of a crow (so as to kill it) at the very moment of its sitting on a branch of that tree; and is used to denote a very unexpected and accidental occurrence, whether welcome or unwelcome; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Candrāloka</ls>: --यत्तया मेलनं तत्र लाभो मे यश्च सुभ्रुवः . तदेतत्काकतालीयमवितर्कितसंभवं .. also <ls>Kuvalayānanda</ls>: --पतत् तालफलं यथा काकेमोपभुक्तमेवं रहोदर्शनक्षुभितहृदया तन्वी मया भुक्ता . see काकतालीय also. <P>8. काकदंतगवेषणन्यायः The maxim of searching after a crow's teeth, used to denote any useless, unprofitable, or impossible task. <P>9. काकाक्षिगोलकन्यायः The maxim of the crow's eyeball. It takes its origin from the supposition that the crow has but one eye (<ab>cf.</ab> words like एकदृष्टि, एकाक्ष &c.), and that it can move it, as occasion requires, from the socket on one side into that of the other; and the maxim is applied to a word or phrase which, though used only once in a sentence, may, if occasion requires, serve two purposes; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} द्वीपोऽस्त्रियामंतरीपः इत्यत्र अस्त्रियामित्यस्य काकाक्षिगोलकन्यायेम अंतरीपशब्देनाप्यन्वयः. <P>10. कूपयंत्रघाटिकान्यायः The maxim of the buckets attached to the water-wheel. It takes its origin from the fact that while some of the buckets filled with water go up, some are emptied of their contents, while others go down quite empty; and is used to denote the various vicissitudes of worldly existence; <ab>cf.</ab> --कांश्चित्तुच्छयति प्रपूरयति वा कांश्चिन्नयत्युन्नतिं कांश्चित्पातविधौ करोति च पुनः कांश्चिन्नयत्याकुलान् . अन्योन्यप्रतिपक्षसंहतिमिमां लोकस्थितिं बोधयन्नेष क्रीडति कूपयंत्रघटिकान्यायप्रसक्तो विधिः .. <ls>Mk. 10. 59.</ls> <P>11. घट्टकुटीप्रभातन्यायः The maxim of day-break near a toll-station. It takes its origin from the attempt of one (say, a cartman) who with the intention of avoiding a toll takes at night an unfrequented road, but unfortunately finds himself at day-break near that very tollstation, and is obliged to pay the toll which he studiously tried to avoid. Thus the maxim is used to denote the occurrence of that which one studiously tries to avoid; <ab>cf.</ab> Śrīharṣa: --तदिदं घट्टकुटीप्रभातन्यायमनुवदति. <P>12. घुणाक्षरन्यायः The maxim of letters bored by an insect in wood. It takes its origin from the unexpected and chance resemblance of an incision in wood or in the leaf of a book made by an insect to the form of some letter, and is used to denote any fortuitous or chance occurrence. <P>13. दंडापूपन्यायः The maxim of the stick and cakes. When a stick and cakes are tied together, and one says that ‘the stick has been pulled down or eaten by a rat’, we are naturally led to expect that the cakes also have been pulled down or eaten by the rat, as a matter of course, the two being so closely connected together; so, when one thing is closely connected with another in a particular way, and we say something of the one, it naturally follows that what we assert of the one can, as a matter of course, be asserted of the other; <ab>cf.</ab> --मूषिकेण दंडो भक्षितः इत्यनेन तत्सहचरितमपूपभक्षणमर्थादायातं भवतीति नियतसमानन्यायादर्थांतरमापततीत्येष न्यायो दंडापूपिका .. <ls>S. D. 10.</ls> <P>14 देहलीदीपन्यायः The maxim of the lamp placed over the threshold. It takes its origin from a lamp hanging over the threshold of a house which, by its peculiar position, serves to light the rooms on both sides, and is used to denote something which serves a two-fold purpose at the same time. <P>15. नृपनापितपुत्रन्यायः The maxim of the king and barber's son. It is used to denote a man's innate fondness for his own possession-howsoever ugly or despicable in the eyes of others. It takes its origin from a story which states that a king on one occasion asked his barber to bring to him the finest boy that he could see in his kingdom. The barber roamed for a long time over every part of the realm, but could discover no boy such as the king wanted. At last wearied and disappointed, he returned home; and being charmed with the beauty of his own boy-who, to do him justice, was a personification of ugliness and deformity-went to the king and presented the boy to him. The king was at first very angry with the barber for having trifled with him, but on consideration excused him, as he ascribed the barber's preference of his own ugly boy to the dominant desire of human beings to consider their own possessions as supremely good; <ab>cf.</ab> -सर्वः कांतमात्मीयं पश्यति <ls>Ś. 2.</ls> <P>16. पंकप्रक्षालनन्यायः The maxim of washing off the mud. Just as it is more advisable for one to avoid getting into mud than to get into it and then wash it off, so it is more advisable for one to avoid getting into danger than to expose oneself to it and then try to get out of it somehow or other; <ab>cf.</ab> --प्रक्षालनाद्धि पंकस्य दूरादस्पर्शनं वरं; and also “Prevention is better than cure”. <P>17. पिष्टपेषणन्यायः The maxim of grinding flour or meal, used to denote a superfluous or unprofitable exertion like the attempt of a man to grind pounded flour; <ab>cf.</ab> कृतस्य करणं वृथा. <P>18. बीजांकुरन्यायः The maxim of seed and sprout. It takes its origin from the relation of mutual causation which subsists between seed and sprout, ({%seed%} being the cause of {%sprout%}, which in its turn is the cause of {%seed%}); and is used in those cases where two things stand to each other in the relation of both cause and effect. <P>19. लोहचुंबकन्यायः The maxim of iron and magnet; it is used to denote a very close affinity between two things, by virtue of which they are instinctively attracted towards each other, though at a distance. <P>20. वह्निधूमन्यायः The maxim of the invariable concomitance of fire and smoke; (wherever there is smoke there is fire.). It is used to denote such invariable concomitance between two persons or things; ({%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} where there is A, there is B; where there is not B, there is not A.). <P>21. विषकृमिन्यायः The maxim of the worms bred in poison. It is used to denote a state of things which, though fatal to others, is not so to those who being bred in it, are inured or naturalized to it, like poison which, though fatal to others, is not so to the worms bred in it. <P>22. विषवृक्षन्यायः The maxim of the poison-tree; used to denote that a thing, though hurtful and mischievous, does not deserve to be destroyed by the very person who has reared it, just as even a poisontree ought not to be cut down by the planter himself. <P>23. वीचितरंगन्यायः The maxim of a wave urging forward a wave. In the ocean one wave propels another till the first and all others in succession reach the shore. So this maxim is used to denote successive operation, as in the case of the production of sound. <P>24. वृद्धकुमारीवाक्य(वर)न्यायः The maxim of the old virgin's boon; that is, asking such a boon as will cover all that one wishes to have. The Mahābhāṣya says that an old virgin, when asked by Indra to choose a boon, said: --पुत्रा मे बहुक्षीरघृतमोदनं कांचनपात्र्यां भुंजीरन्. This one boon, if granted, would give her a husband, progeny, abundance of corn, cattle &c., and gold. <P>25. शाखाचंद्रन्यायः The maxim of the bough and the moon. As the moon, though considerably distant from the bough of a tree, is spoken of as ‘the moon on the bough,’ because she appears to be near it, so this maxim is used when the position of an object, though at a very great distance, is fixed by that of another object to which it appears to be contiguous. <P>26. सिंहावलोकनन्यायः The maxim of the lion's backward glance. It is used when one casts a retrospective glance at what he has left behind, while at the same time he is proceeding, just as the lion, while going onward in search of prey, now and then bends his neck backwards to see if anything be within his reach; see under सिंह also. <P>27. सूचीकटाहन्यायः The maxim of the needle and the kettle. It is used to denote that when two things-the one easy and the other difficult-are required to be done, the easier should be first attended to, as when one has to prepare a needle and a kettle, he should first take in hand a needle as it is an easier work compared with the preparation of a kettle. <P>28. स्थालीपुलाकन्यायः The maxim of the cooking-pot and boiled rice. In a cooking-pot all the grains being equally moistened by the heated water, when one grain is found to be well cooked, the same may be inferred with regard to the other grains. So the maxim is used when the condition of the whole class is inferred from that of a part; <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>Mar.</ab> ‘शितावरून भाताची परीक्षा’. <P>29. स्थूणानिखननन्यायः The maxim of digging or fixing in the post. As a stake or post to be firmly fixed in the ground is again and again moved and thrust inward, so this maxim is used when one (say, a disputant) adds several corroborative illustrations, arguments &c. to strengthen and confirm still more his strong position. <P>30. स्वामिभृत्यन्यायः The maxim of master and servant. It is used to mark the relation of the feeder and the fed, or the supporter and the supported, subsisting between any two objects. "
