        "content": "--दत्ता {1} <ab>N.</ab> of a work by Subandhu. {2} <ab>N.</ab> of a heroine of several stories. [Different writers give different accounts of this lady. According to Kathāsaritsāgara she was the daughter of king Caṇḍamahāsena of Ujjayinī and was carried off by Udayana, king of Vatsa. Śrīharṣa represents her to be the daughter of king Pradyota (see <ls>Ratn. 1. 10</ls>), and, according to Mallinātha's comment on the line प्रद्योतस्य प्रियदुहितरं वत्सराजोऽत्र जह्रे she was the daughter of Pradyota king of Ujjayinī. Bhavabhūti says that she was betrothed by her father to king Saṃjaya, but that she offered herself to Udayana; (see <ls>Māl. 2</ls>). But the Vāsavadattā of Subandhu has nothing in common with the story of Vatsa, except the name of the heroine, as she is represented to have been betrothed by her father to Puṣpaketu, but carried off by Kandarpaketu. It is probable that there were several heroines bearing the name Vāsavadattā.]. "
