        "content": "श्रीहर्ष The reputed author of the Naiṣadhacarita and of {7} or {8} other works. He is generally placed in the latter half of the 12th century. (Wilson says that Śrīharṣa succeeded his father Kalaśa in 1113, and that the Ratnāvalī, a play ascribed to the king, must have been written by him between 1113 and 1125 the close of his reign. But the Ratnāvalī must be regarded as a work of an earlier date as it is largely quoted in the Daśarūpa, a work of the last part of the 10th century). "
