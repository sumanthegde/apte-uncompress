They are very fond of bathing, can change their shapes, and are endowed with superhuman power (प्रभाव). They are called स्वर्वेश्याः and are usually described as the servants of Indra, who, when alarmed by the rigorous austerities of some mighty sage, sends down one of them to disturb his penance, and her mission is generally successful; <ab>cf.</ab> या तपोविशेषपरिशंकितस्य सुकुमारं प्रहरणं महेंद्रस्य <ls>V. 1.</ls> They are also said to covet heroes who die gloriously on the battle-field; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 7. 53.</ls> Bāṇa mentions 14 different families of these nymphs (see <ls>K. 136</ls>).
