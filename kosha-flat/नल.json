He was chosen by Damayantī in spite of the opposition of gods, and they lived happily for some years. But Kali-who was disappointed in securing her hand-resolved to persecute Nala, and entered into his person. Thus affected he played at dice with his brother, and having lost everything, he, with his wife, was banished from the kingdom. One day, while wandering through the wilderness, he abandoned his wife, almost naked, and went away. Subsequently he was deformed by the serpent Karkoṭaka, and so deformed he entered the service of king Ṛtuparṇa of Ayodhyā as a horsegroom under the name of Bāhuka. Subsequently with the assistance of the king he regained his beloved, and they led a happy life; see ऋतुपर्ण and दमयंती also]. {@--3@} <ab>N.</ab> of a monkey-chief, son of Viśvakarman, who, it is said, built the bridge of stones called Nalasetu or ‘Adam's bridge’ over which Rāma passed to Laṅkā with his army. --लं {@--1@} A lotus. {@--2@} Smell, odour."
