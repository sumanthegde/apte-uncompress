He afterwards gave it to his brother Prasena, from whom it passed into the hands of the monkey-chief Jāmbavat, who got possession of it after having killed Prasena. Kṛṣṇa, however, overtook Jāmbavat and vanquished him in fight after a long struggle. The monkeychief thereupon presented it along with his daughter to Kṛṣṇa; see जांबवत्. Kṛṣṇa then gave the jewel back to its proper owner Satrājit, who out of gratitude presented it along with his daughter Satyabhāmā to him. Afterwards when Satyabhāmā was at her father's house with the jewel, Śatadhanvan, at the instigation of a Yādava named Akrūra who desired the jewel for himself, killed Satrājit and gave it to Akrūra. Śatadhanvan was afterwards killed by Kṛṣṇa, but when he found that the jewel was with Akrūra, he allowed him to retain it with himself after having once shown it to the people.] "
