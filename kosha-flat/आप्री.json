The objects invoked are 12:--Susamiddha, Tanūnapāt, Narāśaṃsa, the divine being bearing invocations to the gods, Barhis, the doors of the sacrificial chamber, night and dawn, the two divine beings protecting the sacrifice, the three goddesses Ilā, Sarasvatī, and Mahī, Tvaṣṭṛ, Vanaspati and Svāhā, (all these being regarded by Sāyaṇa to be different forms of Agni); स एता आप्रीरपश्यत्ताभिर्वैस मुखत आत्मानमाप्रीणीत; <ab>cf.</ab> also Max Müller's <ls>Hist. Anc. Lit. pp. 463-466.</ls> "
