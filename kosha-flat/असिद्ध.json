It is of three kinds:--(1) आश्रयासिद्ध where the existence of any such locality (आश्रय) as that where the property is said to reside, is not established; as ‘गगनारविंदं सुरभि अरविंदत्वात्’; (2) स्वरूपासिद्ध where the nature (स्वरूप) alleged does not really reside in the subject (पक्ष); as शब्दो गुणः चाक्षुषत्वात्; and (3) व्याप्यतासिद्ध where the alleged invariableness of concomitance is not real (the साध्यत्व not residing in साध्य); as पर्वतो वह्निमान् कांचनमयधूमात्."
