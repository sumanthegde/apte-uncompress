        "content": "शकारः The brother of a king's concubine, the brother-in-law of a king by a wife not regularly married (अनूढाभ्रातृ); (he is usually represented as a strange mixture of pride, folly, and vanity, of low family, and raised to power by reason of his relation to the king. In the Mṛcchakaṭikā of Śūdraka where he plays a prominent part, his character is well exhibited in his lightness and frivolity of spirit, vain-glory, constant references to his high connection, his blundering and ludicrous folly, but withal cruelty enough to throttle the heroine when she refused to yield to his desire; <ls>S. D.</ls> thus defines him: --मदमूर्खताभिमानी दुष्कुलतैश्वर्यसंयुक्तः . सोयमनूढाभ्राता राज्ञः श्यालः शकार इत्युक्तः .. <ls n=\"S. D.\">81</ls>). "
